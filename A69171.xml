            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But <hi>(tantae molis erit Romanam euertere gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem)</hi> it fell out otherwiſe. For not long after it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared that it was an eaſier matter to hurle out the Pope then poperie at a ſuddaine. In ſo much as<note n="*" place="margin">Ould Docter Turner.</note> one in a prety pamphlet, intituled, <hi>The hunting of the Foxe,</hi> by the induſtry of ſuch hounds as there he ſet on worke, and by print of the <hi>Beaſts</hi> footing which in many corners he obſerued, he deſcried, &amp; withal cried out that the <hi>Foxe</hi> was ſtill in the land.

And this auncient and receaued opinion touching the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred authoritie of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> continewed many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations and was neuer in the meane time controuled by anie, ſaue onlie the Greeke Biſhops, and that but by a few of them. And in truth therein the <hi>Grecians</hi> ſhewed themſelues to bee of a more free iudgement, and wiſer diſpoſition then were our men, and the Biſhop of the Latine Churches, for they (as appeareth by the writings of <hi>Nilus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica,</hi> an eloquent man) earneſtly auouched that Antichriſt, was not onelie come, and ſeated in the Church of God, but that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> himſelf was the very partie, and this they enforced with ſuch pregnant and ſtrong proofes: as the beſt proctours that euer that Sea had, were neuer able as yet to ouerthrow. But as for the Weſterne Biſhops, they indeed
<pb facs="tcp:11444:5"/> diſagreed in this pointe, but not vpon anie good ground or ſetled iudgement, but only caried away by the preiudice of commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cuſtome: nay, they being deceiued by the great ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of Satan (who now bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to worke the miſterie of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as <hi>Paule</hi> had fore-tould) proceeded further, and gaue their helping hand to the ſpreding abroad of that peſtilent infectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (the ſuppreſſion whereof it behooued each chriſtian to haue endeuoured) and very buſie and pettiſh they were in helping and vpholding it, and in putting Oyle as you would ſaie, to the fire. And ſo in proceſſe of time the ſaid Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> became as big as<note n="a" place="margin">Monſtrous Giant which had a hundred Armes.</note> 
               <hi>Briareus</hi> (as it is in the Prouerbe) who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was as little as a fooliſh <hi>Leueret.</hi> At firſt in verie deed, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the raigne of the <hi>Henries,</hi> and after of the <hi>Fredericks,</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours of <hi>Germanie</hi> the Kingdome of Antichriſt receiued great ſtrength and encroched vpon the conſciences of men of all ſortes. For although euen from the daies of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelues, Sathan began to lay the foundation thereof, yet by reaſon of the bright ſhining light of the Goſpel, which in thoſe dayes was kept in all integritie in the Churche, hee tooke repulſe, and ſo by meanes of the worke which GOD himſelf had (as it were) newly proclaimed and taken in hand he was inforced to be quiet &amp; to defer his buſines vnto ſome other time. Afterwards, looke what he had long ſince begon and ſomewhat brought forward hee found the meanes to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and bring to perfection vnder the Raigne of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Bearded or which had a great beard.</note> 
               <hi>Pogonatus,</hi> an Emperour of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Now Sathan being by the meanes and induſtrie of Antichriſt (as it were his legate) once ſet ouer the Chriſtian Church as it were in a Chaire of Eſtate: he neſtled himſelf therein ſo ſure, that after it proued a thing almoſt inpoſſible by any power or pollicie to remoue him thence: but (euen as the ſtrong armed man of whome Chriſt ſpeaketh in <hi>Mathew</hi>) looke how more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently he was aſſaulted by the valiant Souldiers of Chriſts Church <hi>Arnold, Wickliffe, Huſſe, Jerom of Prage,</hi> and ſome moe ſuch like. So did he as buſilie oppoſe againſt them more wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and vncleane ſpirits, as a ſupplie of freſh Souldiers in way of reſkew. For the pompe &amp; power of Antichriſt was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by ſuch men as were of as lewd a diſpoſition and of as
<pb facs="tcp:11444:6"/> brazen faces as euer liued; and that not onlie long agoe: but euen of late in our dayes as by <hi>Eckius, Faber, Cochley</hi> and ſuch other prating Iackes, of the like ſtampe, by whoſe toyle-ſome trauailes, mingled with cauills, coggs, and couzning trickes, the cauſe was a while cheriſhed and vpheald. But God, the father of all mercies, in great compaſſion, pitying the eſtate of the world; vouchſafed in this old-age thereof to raiſe and ſend amongſt vs the light of his glorious Goſpel: the power whereof, is the onlie inſtrument to bring Antichriſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foote. Therefore, he lightened the minds of our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, diſplayed the foggie Miſts of Antichriſtian darknes, and ſtirred vp his worthy ſeruaunts, as valiaunt Champions, to bruſe and breake, to quell and kil the power of Antichriſt. For in this quarraile wherein Antichriſt was to be encounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, manie haue dealt with verie proſperous ſucceſſe. As firſt and cheiflie <hi>M. Luther,</hi> and after him, (for let me ſpeake it without the offence of ſome, hee was not the laſt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets) <hi>Hen.

For ſuch is the nature of this quarrell and controuerſie, that it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the helping hands of manie workmen: the ſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is ſuch, as by means of ſome darke places in the Scriptures it could not on a ſuddaine ſo throughlie bee ſeene into, but daylie more and more be cleared and made plaine.

It may likewiſe be permitted vnto me to conferre ſome places thereof with this of <hi>Paule,</hi> and, but briefly to expound them, leaſt if I ſhould ſtand long vpon the interpretation of them, I ſhould ſeeme to ſome, to be too tedious, and to ouer-reach the ſet limits of my purpoſed argument.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt firſt, ſome haue moued this doubt or queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether this ſpeach of <hi>Paule</hi> be to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted a prophecie and extraordinarie reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God, or only an aduiſed and plaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Scripture, which before had vttered (but ſomewhat obſcurely) that which <hi>Paule</hi> heere more plainely deliuereth. For, as for <hi>Paule,</hi> we know he was an Apoſtle: and, as himſelfe witneſſeth, Apoſtles are in their functions and callings diſtinguiſhed from Prophets, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.11. Therefore ſome are of opinion, that this place of <hi>Paule,</hi> is but a graue and ſound expoſition of ſome other places of Scripture either out of <hi>Daniell cap.</hi> 7. &amp; 11. or out of <hi>Math.</hi> 24. or <hi>Luke</hi> 21. But (in my iudgement) it may more truly be affirmed, that this place of <hi>Paule,</hi> as others ſuch like, is a meere prophecie, and extraordinarie, as we knowe <hi>Paule</hi> had many ſuch gifts giuen him, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. among which alſo, the gift of prophecying is one, a proofe whereof, we haue 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. and in other places of his writings, we finde other notable and extraordinarie reuelations, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21. And it maketh no matter, though the gifts of Apoſtleſhip and of prophecie, be ſeuerall and diuers: for this indéede is true, if we conſider and weigh them by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as they be in their owne natures: but, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding God many times beſtowes them both vpon one and the ſelfe-ſame man. As for example, <hi>Peter</hi> by a ſpeciall reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God, fore-told his death, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14. Againe, <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangeliſt was a Prophet (as appeareth by the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypſe</hi>) and alſo an Euangeliſt. Further, we are not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt it abſurd, that this one and the ſelfe-ſame matter ſhould
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:11444:11"/> be fore-told both by Chriſt himſelfe, and after by <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> in as much as it often commeth to paſſe, that many Prophets haue ſpoken of one and the ſame thing. For it is well ſpoken of <hi>Bernard, There was one ſpirit</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that guided all the Prophets, although they foreſawe, and fore-ſhewed one thing at diuers times, in diuers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and with ſundry ſignes.</hi>

                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:11444:12"/> plauſibly, and publikely receiued. Whereunto I aunſwere, that this was done and fore-tolde in a double reſpect, both in regard of the godly, and vngodly.</p>
               <p>In regard of the godly, firſt, that they ſhould not take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence when they ſhould ſée thoſe things come to paſſe (which they knowe were fore-told) and that by the will and iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. Secondly, that they, or we, ſhould not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make the leſſe accompt of the Goſpell as leſſe glorious and heauenly, for that it ſhould come to paſſe that it ſhould be publikely, and in euery place reiected, and that men ſhould vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſally and in heapes fall from the imbracing of the ſame, therefore we ſée how in reſpect héereof this point of prophecie was requiſite for the comfort of the godly, and ſtay of the Church.</p>
               <p>And as for the wicked, it ſerues to tell them, that the wrath of God is then ready to be poured on their heads, when they ſhall ſee thoſe things fullfilled, after which, the laſt iudgement of God, and their vtter deſtruction ſhould immediatly inſue.</p>
               <p>And therefore in theſe two reſpects, both Chriſt himſelfe in the 24. of <hi>Math.</hi> and the ſpirit of God throughout the whole <hi>Reuelation,</hi> did plainely fore-tell, what ſhould befall the Church, reueiling euen the moſt wofull and dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.

               <p>Agayne, reaſon it ſelfe inforceth, that it cannot bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of one man, but of a multitude and kingdome.

               <p>Laſtly, the euent hereof declareth that it is to be vnderſtood vniuerſally of the eſtate of the Church &amp; of the whole world, the which hath continued many ages, and as yet is in vre, and not of the life or age of any one man: For the life of one man (though he were of a great age) is but ſhort, if it be compared with the time of this defection, which hath laſted now full out <hi>900.</hi> yeares. And as touching this <hi>Apoſtacie,</hi> or falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, it is a wofull or moſt miſerable <hi>Eſtate,</hi> or condition of things, which ſhould take place in the world before the ſecond
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:11444:13"/> comming of Chriſt, wherein ſhould be not only a fearfull and lamentable perſecution and ſlaughter of the Church: but alſo a killing, and almoſt a finall quelling and putting out of all Chriſtian faith, from the face of the earth, becauſe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, publikly, and in euery corner, a doctrine moſt falſe and contrarie to the Goſpell, ſhould bee admitted, approoued, and publiſhed, and that in the midſt of the Church it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>This expoſition of mine is warranted, firſt by the words of Chriſt himſelfe <hi>Luk. 18.8. When the ſonne of man ſhall come, do ye thinke he ſhall finde faith vpon the earth?</hi> And of <hi>Math. 24.12. The loue of many</hi> (whereby <hi>Faith</hi> in that place is meant) <hi>ſhall waxe colde.</hi> Therefore that miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable eſtate of the Church (made known vnto vs by the name of Antichriſt) reacheth to many, and concerneth not one alone. So alſo it is warranted by the Prophecie of <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation Chap. 17.1. &amp; 18.3.</hi> where ſo great and ſo farre ſpreading power of this <hi>Apoſtacie</hi> is in ſuch ſort deſcribed, as that it is there tearmed an <hi>Harlot,</hi> (flat oppoſite and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to Chriſt) which with her poyſon and corrupt doctrine ſhould infect the Kings and Nations of the earth. Loſtly, it is warranted by the 1. <hi>Iohn Cap. 2. verſ. 18.</hi> where it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant that the name of Antichriſt is attributed to many. Vpon the which place Maiſter <hi>Caluin</hi> writeth thus. <hi>Paule (2. Theſ. 2.3.) ſpeaking of the Apoſtacie, or falling away that ſhould inſue, plainlie giueth it out, that it ſhould bee a bodie, or as you would ſay, a kingdome of defection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being ſo, wee may from hence gather and conclude, (and that vpon an Antecedent (or thing gone before) that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the laſt comming of Chriſt this was to be fulfilled, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Goſpell ſhould bee preached ouer the face of the earth, the Church generally enlarged and planted, and the doctrine of ſaluation publikly receiued, the which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour himſelfe fore-tolde <hi>Math. 26.13.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for the due and orderly handling of this poynt, let vs ſee what this word <hi>Apoſtata</hi> ſignifieth. Apoſtates or back-ſliders are otherwiſe taken and defined among the Lawyers,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:11444:13"/> then they he among the Diuines. The Ciuill law tearmeth that Souldier an Apoſtate, which flieth from his Campe, and with-draweth himſelfe from the alleagiance that he oweth to his Captaine. So doth <hi>Modeſtinus</hi> the Lawyer write <hi>[in L. Deſertores. D. de re milita:]</hi> for hée termeth him a <hi>Runna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtate</hi> Souldier, who hath béen ſtraggling long from his tents, although after he be brought back agayne.</p>
               <p>But among the Diuines <hi>[L. Apostatae C. de Apostatis]</hi> Apoſtates are otherwiſe accompted: namely, ſuch as betray and renounce their holie and Chriſtian profeſſion once made and receiued. On the other ſide, the Schoole-men and Papiſts do yet make an other reckoning of Apoſtates, and deſcribe them to bee ſuch as breake the rule and leaue the order of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the which with a vow they once tooke vpon them. But doubtleſſe in this place of <hi>Paule</hi> which we haue now in hand, he neither talketh of Militarie diſcipline, nor of Popiſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, which as yet were not hatched. Therefore the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacie</hi> or defection that he ſpeaketh of here, muſt needes bee vnderſtood either of a departing from the Chriſtian faith, or from ſubiection vnder the Empyre of <hi>Rome.</hi> And in deede, ſome haue vnderſtood it of the Romane Empyre, (as <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius lib. 7. cap. 15. August. lib. 20. De ciuitate Dei. cap. 19. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom ad Algaſ. quaeſt. 11.</hi>) which opinion how true it is, let vs conſider. To ſpeake briefly in the poynt, this is my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that this place of <hi>Paule</hi> cannot bee meant only of the Empyre of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that in many reſpects. Firſt, <hi>Paule</hi> intreateth not in that place of earthly kingdomes, or chaunge of Common wealthes, but deliuereth doctrine touching Chriſtian faith. Agayne, the iſſue of the matter (which is the beſt expoſitour of this Prophecie that can be) doth ſhewe no leſſe. For the kingdome of Antichriſt was not ſo much a with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of ſubiection from the Romane Empyre, as a deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of obedience vnto the word of God. Further, <hi>Damaſcen (lib. 4. cap. 27. de orthodoxa ſide)</hi> maketh for me, affirming that Antichriſt ſhould come after that the doctrine of the Goſpell were once ſpread abroad. Laſtly, all the auncient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               <p>Therefore this <hi>Apoſtacie,</hi> which is the ground and piller of the eſtate of Antichriſt, is a back-ſliding or departure from the true doctrine of Chriſtian faith.</p>

For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> once this generall defection ſhall haue ſet in foote, how may a man then ſafely make this collection, <hi>This doctrine is true, and Apoſtolike, becauſe it is publikely receiued, taught, and allowed commonly in euery Congregation.</hi> For <hi>Paule</hi> hath ſaid that it ſhould come to paſſe, that a doctrine contrarie to that of the Goſpell ſhould be admitted, yea, and that with approbation, into the very Churches in euery place, publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Indeede the auncient Writers were wont to vſe this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument (of ſucceſſion and conſent:) and before this defection it was both a forcible, and ſound kinde of proofe: but now, it's nothing ſo. The ſecond is, that a man can not rightly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and conclude, that the true Church and true doctrine is there to be found, where there hath bin inuiolably kept and obſerued a continuall and orderly ſucceſſion of perſons. For ſeeing this defection was to take place and continue long in the very Church of God, euen through many ſucceſſions of perſons and ages of men: how may a man thence gather and conclude ſubſtantially, that therefore the Church of God is to be found in the midſt of theſe back-ſliders, becauſe that there are to be ſeene a continuall ſucceſſion of perſons, whereas thoſe perſons be the verie Apoſtates themſelues.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, from thence may be obſerued, that this is a falſe poſition in Poperie, which notwithſtanding the Schoole-men maintaine with tooth, and naile, namely, that the Church can not erre: nay, it is certaine that it can, and that not only one perticular Church, or two, but many plentiful Congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, yea, whole Counſailes, and to make ſhort, the vniuerſall Church it ſelfe, whoſe fall, the ſpirit of God fore-warned, and the euent or iſſue thereof hath ſince verified.</p>

In like manner as <hi>Paule, 1. Cor. 4.1. by man</hi> in the ſingular nomber vnderſtandeth many, which kinde of ſpeache is vſuall and familiar to ſuch as follow the Hebrew phraſe, the which <hi>Paule</hi> in his writings doth greatly affect and imitate.</p>

                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:11444:15"/> affirmeth, namely, that Antichriſt ſhould not be one of the Diuels that ſhould take vpon him the fleſh and ſubſtance of man (euen as our Sauiour tooke vnto him our humane nature) although notwithſtanding ſuch as ſhould become Antichriſts, ſhould be poſſeſſed with a diueliſh diſpoſition, and caried in enmitie againſt God. Truth it is, the Papiſts will haue it vnderſtoode of one ſingular and priuate man, who one day ſhould liue and kéepe a ſtirre, and further, that he ſhould ariſe out of the tribe of <hi>Dan:</hi> but in this their dotage, they relie vpon no ground of Scripture, and therefore they are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>méete in this point to be dealt withall. Others there are (and that learned men to) that are of opinion that this is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode indéede of one man, but ſuch an one, as among all the route of Apoſtates, ſhould be the moſt peruerſe, the chiefe, and ring-leader of all the reſt: for (ſay they) there is one head of the godly and faithfull, euen Chriſt Ieſus. And touching the name of this one principall, &amp; arch-Apoſtata: they thinke it is as well couertly inſinuated in this place of <hi>Paule,</hi> as alſo eſpecially bewrayed in the <hi>13.</hi> of the <hi>Reuelation, verſ. 18.</hi> where the figures &amp; letters of the ſaid name are ſaid to make vp the nomber of <hi>666.</hi> And (to ſay the truth) this opinion is generally receiued, and ſeemeth to be ſomewhat likely. Vnto theſe points I will addreſſe mine anſwere. And firſt touching the firſt. Although it be very true, that there is one principall head of all the vnfaithfull, yet he is not any perticular &amp; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man (ſuch as it appeareth <hi>Math. 24.</hi> that famous Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhould be) but euen Sathan himſelfe, that old Serpent, who alſo is called the <hi>Dragon.</hi> And as for the ſecond opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, me thinks it is weake and wauereth in it ſelfe, in as much as that place of the <hi>Apocalypſe, cap. 13. verſ. 18.</hi> is wrongly interpreted of any certaine name, title, or calling of any one man, the letters whereof ſhould conteine the nomber of <hi>666.</hi> For the Spirit of God in that place medleth not with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticall ſignification of letters wherewith any word is framed: but of the time and nomber of yeares wherein thoſe things ſhould be accompliſhed that are there ſpoken of. For
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:11444:16"/> the Scripture neuer vſeth to deale in ſuch manner of Sorcers &amp; fooliſh myſtery by letters, which is but flat iuggling of the <hi>Cabaliſts,</hi> and damned dotages of the <hi>Magicians:</hi> but, it v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to ſpeake very plainely, when it fore-telleth of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of any, as namely, when it fore-ſheweth the comming of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Ioſias,</hi> and that an hundred yeares before they came indeede. Therefore looke what men are any where by the Spirit of God ſpoken of, they be mentioned vnder their plaine, proper, and peculiar names, and not by ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of words: as, <hi>Cyrus, Ioſias, Ieſus Chriſt &amp;c.</hi> as I ſaid before. And to the end we may the better ſee into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, let vs examine the words of the text it ſelfe, <hi>Reuel. 13. verſ. 18. Heere is wiſedome. Let him that hath vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, coumpt the nomber of the Beaſt, for it is the nomber of a man, and his nomber is ſixe hundred three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ſixe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I would demaund of what tongue, or language that word or name ſhould be, the letters whereof muſt be ſearched after, whether it ſhould be an Hebrew, Gréeke or Latin word: for (as <hi>Auguſt.</hi> affirmeth, <hi>lib. 12. de Geneſi ad literam</hi>) theſe three languages were alwaies accoumpted principall among al men. Truely they that firſt brought vp that interpretation, whereof I ſpeake (as namely <hi>Irenaeus lib. 5.</hi>) do euen folter in the matter, and labour their wittes in deuiſing any one word, whoſe letters would amount vnto the number of <hi>666.</hi> And yet <hi>Euſebius (lib. 5. hiſtor. cap. 8.)</hi> followeth that which he ſaw <hi>Irenaeus</hi> to haue ſet downe before him: I could my ſelfe deuiſe many ſuch wordes, but it would bee to no purpoſe.

                  </gap>, ſhould bee the proper name of Antichriſt.

So the kingdome and all the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> are ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed vnder the figure of one Beare: of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> vnder the ſhape of a Leopard. So alſo all ſuch as ſhould bée the principalles and hold the helme (as you would ſay) in that Apoſtacie, are reſembled by the name of a <hi>Beaſt</hi> in the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar number.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:11444:17"/> himſelfe: whereupon in an other place he is called <hi>Apollyon,</hi> (as namely <hi>Apoc. 9.12.</hi>) becauſe he is the author of all peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent infection, and deſtruction both of bodie and ſoule. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is well termed by <hi>Paule, The ſonne of perdition,</hi> whom the Spirit of God calleth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, deſtroyed, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying.</p>
               <p>And although he be in other places commonly called by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> (as in the <hi>1.</hi> of <hi>Iohn, &amp; 4.</hi>) yet it ſeemeth that <hi>Paule</hi> made choyſe rather thus to deſcribe him for two reſpects. Firſt, becauſe that manner of expreſſing him, carieth with it a greater vehemencie, and repreſenteth more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally his deteſtable wickedneſſe and blaſphemie, when he is ſayd to bee a moſt vile and abhominable wretch. Secondly, becauſe, that by this meanes, we are better directed in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of what kinde of Antichriſt to vnderſtand this place. For (as <hi>Origen</hi> ſayth vpon <hi>Math. Hom 30.</hi>) the name of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt is generall and pertaines to many: but here, one of them only is meant, the worſt, the moſt miſcheuous, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible: ſo that hereby he is poynted and paynted out, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the other Antichriſtes ſhould bee the captaine and chiefe Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the ſame Antichriſt is alſo called a <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and an <hi>Whore (Reuelation 17. &amp; 18.</hi>) And it maketh no matter though he bee tearmed there of <hi>Iohn</hi> by the name of a <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>Harlot,</hi> and here of <hi>Paule,</hi> by the name of a <hi>Man.</hi> For here in this place I take it, that his kinde, and nature is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and there, by the names of <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and <hi>Harlot,</hi> that his manners, and diſpoſition are layd open. And therefore this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, or bodie of this <hi>Apoſtacie,</hi> together with the head and principall member of the fame, is in the Scripture, eſpecially compared vnto theſe three things.</p>
               <p>To a <hi>Beaſt,</hi> in reſpect of crueltie, and blockiſh ignorance.</p>
               <p>To a <hi>Woman,</hi> in regard of couetouſneſſe, haughtineſſe, and weaknes of minde.</p>
               <p>To an <hi>Harlot,</hi> for their diſſolute manners: and chiefly their Idolatrie, which is the greateſt kinde of whoredome
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:11444:18"/> that the Scripture ſpeaketh of.</p>
               <p>And touching the crueltie of this kingdome: <hi>Lactantius (lib. 7.)</hi> telleth, that it ſhould bee exceeding great, writing thus of Antichriſt <hi>(cap. 17.) <hi>That ſhall bee a time</hi>
                  </hi> (ſayth he) <hi>wherein Iuſtice ſhall bee troden vnder foote, and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie contemned, wherein the wicked ſhall cruelly pre a vpon the godlie, all things ſhall bee confounded and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vp-ſide downe agaynſt law and nature.</hi> And this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Lactantius</hi> agreeth fitly with that of the <hi>Reuel. (cap. 17.6.)</hi> where Antichriſt is ſayd to bee that <hi>Harlot,</hi> that is made dronken with the bloud of Martyrs, and Saincts of God. Whereby appeareth that Antichriſt ſhould (as he doth) alwaies raiſe bloudy perſecutions againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithful. <hi>Chriſost. (Hom. 40.</hi> on <hi>Math.</hi>) Affirmeth no leſſe, now touching this leſſe, now touching this matter of perſecution, when, or by whome was it euer more practiſed, then it hath bin, and ſtil is, by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that whole retinew? And let this ſuffice brieflie, to be ſpoken of the crueltie of this generation. Concerning the ignorance of it: I finde it thus written in a booke, intituled, <hi>De Antichriſto,</hi> and attributed vnto <hi>Auſtin: <hi>The kingdome of Antichriſt ſhall be furniſhed with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians, Witches, Southſayers and Inchaunters,</hi>
                  </hi> which ſhall teach, and perſwade with all manner of impietie, falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and deteſtable practiſes.</p>
               <p>And where (I pray) may this be found more verified, than among the Papiſtes, and in the kingdome of Poperie. And ſure the Popiſh Clergie (which is the mayne piller of this ſtate and Apoſtacie) being deſcribed by <hi>Peter</hi> in his <hi>2. Epiſt. cap. 2.12. &amp; 15.</hi> is ſaid there to be a kind of brutiſh Beaſtes, which deſpiſe that they know not, and which alwaies forſake the right way. And, experience it ſelfe hath ſhewed it, that they are as great lubberly doles, as euer liued, in ſo much as their Monkes were accoumpted great Clerkes, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Doctors among them: and yet among themſelues, this Prouerbe began (ſpeaking of a Dunce) <hi>As great a Moame as a Monke.</hi>

               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:11444:18"/>
               <p>As for the couetouſnes of that order and kinde of people, I neede not ſpeake much of it, being the caſe is ſo cleare. For <hi>Peter</hi> in the place before alleadged <hi>verſ. 14. They haue hearts exerciſed with couetouſnes.</hi> And in the <hi>18.</hi> of the <hi>Reuel. verſ. 3.</hi> They are called <hi>Merchaunts <hi>Bernard,</hi>

And I pray what was more vſuall, or common to be ſeene in the Papacie, than the practiſe hereof? Or what was there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer more puft vp and inſolent, then that route of the Romiſh rabble?

               <p>As concerning their Idolatry, the penne of euery writer is plentifull in ſhewing how outragious it ſhould be in the kingdome of Antichriſt. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his treatiſe <hi>De Antichriſto, <hi>He ſhall reuiue</hi>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:11444:20"/> place, becauſe it expreſſeth, as it were in colours, the looſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiours of the Romiſh Prelates, I haue thought good to exemplifie it word, for word. <hi>They beare out themſelues</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in an honorable port, with the goods of the Church, whereunto notwithſtanding themſelues bring no credit, or worſhip at all. Hence, commeth that whoriſh tricking, that Stage-like attire, that Prince-like pompe, which daily we ſee in them. Hence, proceedes the golde that they vſe in their bridles, ſaddles, and ſpurres: in ſo much, as their ſpurres are more glittering then their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Hence, came their ſtately tables, their varietie of diſhes, and quaffing cups: hence iſſued their ionketing bankets, their dronkennes, and ſurfaicts: hence, followed their Viols, Harpes, and Shawmes: hence, flowed their Cellers, and Pantries, ſo ſtuffed with wines, and viands of all ſorts: hence gat they their Lee-pots, &amp; painting boxes: and hence, had they their purſſes ſo wel lined with coine: fye vpon it? ſuch men they will needes be, and yet they are our great maiſters in Iſrael, as Deanes, Archdeacons, Biſhops, and Archbiſhops. Theſe works of theirs are little inferiour vnto that filthines, which they commit in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> And laſtly, he addeth theſe words, <hi>For, he is the very Antichriſt.</hi> Let any that liſt, peruſe the whole place, as alſo the ſaid Fathers Epiſtle vnto <hi>Eugenius:</hi> and againe, ſet him reade the little booke of <hi>Nicholas de Clemengis,</hi> wherein, he complaineth of all the orders of the Papacie: And laſtly, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter de Vineis,</hi> in his Epiſtles: To conclude, let him reade, and obſerue what <hi>Platina</hi> himſelfe (who otherwiſe for the moſt part ſhewes himſelfe the Popes claw-backe) writeth of theſe matters in many places, but eſpecially what he reporteth of <hi>Samoſatenus</hi> in the life of <hi>Dioniſius</hi> the firſt, where he ſheweth that neuer was there ſeene, or heard of more retchleſſe, and lewde behauiour, then was found in the pontificall, and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh minions. <hi>Ierome</hi> alſo in his Prologue, <hi>De ſpiritu ſancto,</hi> confirmes this ſame, where he tearmeth <hi>Rome, <hi>Babilon,</hi>

The firſt whereof is that which there is ſaid, to come vp out of the bottomleſſe pit, and is not otherwiſe deſcribed vnto vs by any expreſſe fourme or ſhape, <hi>Reuel. 11.7. &amp; 17.8.</hi> The ſecond is that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vp out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sea, and is there likened vnto many beaſts, as vnto a Leopard, a Beare, and a Lyon: which alſo is there deſcribed to haue ſeauen heads, and ten hornes, euen as his graundſire the Dragon had, <hi>Cap. 13.1. &amp; 12.3.</hi> The third is that, which is there ſaid to be like vnto the ſecond, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing two hornes like vnto the hornes of the Lambe, and this to riſe out of the earth, <hi>Cap. 13.11.</hi> And vnto this Beaſt in

               </p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt Beaſt mentioned in the <hi>11.</hi> Chapter, it is all one with the third, as we may perceiue by the effects of them both. For by either of theſe Beaſts, one, and the ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame order and ſtate of men is ſignified, which was hatched by the Dragon their Sire, and vphelde and maintained by the ſame falſe Prophet. But, in the ſaid <hi>11.</hi> Chapter there is firſt briefely and in generall that ſet downe, which after in more perticular, &amp; plentifull manner is deſcribed, where the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the end, the drift, practiſe, and purpoſe thereof is diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſo we might take the déeper knowledge of it, <hi>Cap. 13. &amp; 17.</hi> And it is all one, to riſe out of the earth, and out of the bottomleſſe pit: for the pit in the Scripture, is ſaid to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the earth: but yet he is ſaid to riſe out of the pit, and out of the earth, in diuers reſpects. For this Beaſt is ſaid to riſe out of the earth, in reſpect héereof, for that they that ſhould ſway, and rule this ſtate and kingdome, ſhould riſe of the riffe-raffe, and ſkomme of the people. Againe, he is ſaid to riſe out of the pit, becauſe thoſe raſkals brewe, &amp; breathe out nothing elſe, but that, that is dogged, dunghill-like, and diueliſh, and flat oppoſite to God, and godlineſſe. Therefore in regard of the baſe condition of thoſe, by whom this gouernment is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadged, this Beaſt and this kingdome is ſaid to riſe out of the earth, that is, of the verie raſkally people. For, for the moſt part, ſuch are the Cardinals of Rome, and ſuch others as are crept vp into the Prelacie, and Primacie in the Kingdome of Popery. And in regard of their precepts, rules, and doctrine, the ſame Beaſt, and this order of men, is ſaid to riſe out of the pit, that is, out of Hell, for that it ſauoureth, teacheth, follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, and enioyeth nothing but diueliſhnes, that is (as the Spirit of God teacheth, <hi>Reuel. 2.24.</hi>) the déepenes of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and out of doubt ſuch is the doctrine of Popery. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt, &amp; ſecond Beaſt is all one, but heerein the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:11444:21"/> that the deſcription of the firſt being but rudely or confuſedly at firſt ſet downe, is after diſtinctly handled and laide open, that ſo we might the more eaſily take knowledge of it. So it is alſo in <hi>Daniell,</hi> (with whome the <hi>Reuelation</hi> is principally to be compared, both in reſpect of the order by them both obſerued, and of their ſtile or manner of writing,) where, after the Prophet had in viſion ſéene the <hi>4.</hi> Monarchs, and ſo briefely ſet downe <hi>Cap. 7.</hi> thoſe things which made for the comfort of the Church, and were to be obſerued in the two latter Monarches: afterwards he rippeth vp the ſame matter againe, and handleth it more diſtinctly and ſeuerally, <hi>Cap. 10. 11.</hi> and as there, ſo héere, there are two Chapters interlaced betwéene the firſt generall propounding, and the laſt more perticular handling of thoſe matters. Wherefore ſéeing the firſt and the third Beaſt ſignifie all one thing: the queſtion is only of the ſecond, whether by it rather then by the third, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt is purtraited, of whome, <hi>Paule</hi> in this place ſpeaketh. Truly, that I may ſpeake my mind briefely in this behalfe, I thinke, that by this ſecond Beaſt, mentioned <hi>Apoc. 13.1.</hi> is ſignified euidently the Romane Empire, being Idolatrous, ſuch as it was, while the Emperours had their reſidence in <hi>Rome,</hi> before they remoued their ſeate to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> For that Romane Empire, together with the ſucceſſion of the Gouernours in the ſame, is purtraited out vnto vs vnder the tipe of ſeauen heads, and ten hornes. But theſe ten were after abridged and brought vnto two: for afterwards there were but two hornes of the Romane Empire, that is, two Princes ſeates, or places of reſidencie: whereof the firſt and moſt aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient was at <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Italie,</hi> the ſecond and latter at <hi>Bizanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in <hi>Thracia,</hi> whether <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the Great tranſlated his manſion or abiding place: whereupon it came to paſſe, that both in generall Counſels, and in the Decrées of Emperours, mention is of two <hi>Romes:</hi> one, the olde, which is the true <hi>Rome,</hi> built by <hi>Romulus:</hi> the other, the new, which is <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which alſo began to holde vp the head, by vertue of the priuiledges &amp; prerogatiue
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:11444:22"/> of olde <hi>Rome.</hi> But betweene theſe two hornes of this one, and the ſame Romane Empire, this was the difference, which alſo is of vs diligently to be obſerued, that ſo long as the horne (or ſeate) was in <hi>Italie,</hi> the Romane Emperours were Idolatours, and their Decrees and Conſtitutions blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous againſt God. But after time, the ſaid Emperours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be Chriſtians, which began in <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, (for whereas ſome writers affirme of <hi>Phillip,</hi> whome <hi>Decius</hi> ſlewe, that he imbraced the Goſpell, certaine it is, that he would be a Chriſtian no otherwiſe but couertly, and not by publike profeſſion) then I ſay firſt of all, and by vpon the necke of it, this ſame Romane Empire was tranſlated from <hi>Italie,</hi> and old <hi>Rome</hi> into <hi>Thrace,</hi> and therein vnto <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</hi> For that this ſhould ſo come to paſſe, the Spirit of God in the <hi>Apoc.</hi> had fore-ſhewed, as after we ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. But yet I graunt that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had no regard vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Prophecie, when he remoued at firſt from <hi>Rome,</hi> to <hi>Bizantium,</hi> and there ſetled his Emperiall Pallaice, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected only a more commodious gouernment of thoſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and kingdomes of his that lay Eaſtward, which at that time were miſerably diſquieted by the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and <hi>Perſians.</hi> For <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> did ſéeme to be ſo ſcituated (whereas other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantine</hi> had once thought to haue ſetled elſe-where) as that it was as you would ſay the nauell or midſt vnto the whole Romane iuriſdiction, which as we knowe, ſpread it ſelfe farre and neere: and yet it could not poſſibly otherwiſe fall out, becauſe that ſo the Romane Empire might become double-headed, and haue thoſe two hornes which God before had reueiled. So the prouidence of God guided this whole enterpriſe of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and ſo fulfilled what him-ſelfe had decreed. And touching this deuiding of the Romane Empire into theſe two heads and hornes, it is warranted out of the <hi>Reuel. 13.11.</hi> and <hi>Zech. 4.8.</hi> and this is the very true inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of that Prophecie, where it is ſaid, that the Beaſt had two hornes. And heere let this be obſerued, that heereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I will coumpt &amp; call that the firſt Beaſt, which in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:11444:22"/> deuiſion and expoſition I made the ſecond, and againe, I will tearme that the ſecond, which before I called the third: for that head of the firſt Beaſt which appeared to be hurt and wounded deadly, was indeede one of the ſeauen before ſpoken of. But that thoſe ſeauen were in the end reduced vnto two only, it appeareth heereby, for that the ſecond Beaſt, which before we called the third, and which conuayed vnto her ſelfe all the power that the former had, is ſayd to haue only two hornes, <hi>Cap. 13. 11.</hi> And it may not ſeeme ſtrange, that in this ſecond Beaſt I interpret otherwiſe of the ſignification of hornes, then I did in the former. For there by hornes were ſpecified the perſons of Kings, as afterward ſhall appeare, becauſe it is added, that thoſe hornes had Diademes, or Crownes on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But as for the hornes of the ſecond Beaſt, they rather note a State, then any perſons, becauſe that theſe hornes are ſaid to reſemble the likeneſſe of the Lambe, ſo that they ſignifie an eſtate or qualitie of a Kingdome. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, this interpretation is to be held as a principall ground, for the better vnderſtanding of many places in the <hi>Reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> whereinto we ſhall a great deale more eaſily ſee, if we ſhall obſerue this diſtinction or deuiſion of this Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire into two imperiall heads. Let vs therefore fall in hand with the expoſition of the place of the <hi>Reuelation, Cap. 13. 1. 2. 3.</hi> the words whereof are theſe.</p>

               <p>Touching the ſeauen heades there attributed vnto this Beaſt, that is, vnto this olde and Idolatrous Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre: ſome will haue them to be the ſeauen men of <hi>Germany,</hi> who ſucceeded in the Empyre, after that the Pope had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted the Empire vnto the <hi>Germanes:</hi> but before that tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of the Empyre, while as yet it was Idolatrous and remained at <hi>Rome,</hi> they were either the ſeauen dignities and preeminent offices of the Citie, (as firſt, the Conſul-ſhip: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Pretour-ſhip: thirdly, the Captaine of the Guard: fourthly, the chiefe Chamberlaine: fiftly, the Treaſourour: ſixtly, the Gentrie: ſeauenthly, and the Senate) or elſe they were the ſeauen Prouinces, whereby the Romane Empyre was eſpecially ſuſtayned, whereof the firſt and principall was <hi>Italie</hi> it ſelfe: ſecond, all <hi>Fraunce</hi> as farre as the <hi>Rhene,</hi> and the Mountaine <hi>Pyrenaei:</hi> thirdly, all <hi>Spayne:</hi> fourthly, <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie,</hi> with <hi>Slauonia:</hi> fiftly, <hi>Macedonia,</hi> wherunto <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Thrace</hi> is annexed: ſixtly, <hi>Egipt</hi> with all <hi>Affrica:</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I am not ignorant, that in it were diuers Prouinces and Lieutenauntries, as appeareth by the knowledge of the Romiſh Iuriſdiction: but herein, we are not to conſider how they ordered and diſpoſed matters, for their ſecuritie &amp; quicke diſpatch of affayres, but what the places were from whence their reuenues grewe, and from whence they vſually fetched their newe ſupplie of Souldiers) ſeauently, <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> the leſſe. But as for that region &amp; part of <hi>Syria</hi> which coaſts along the Riuer <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and was indeed vnder the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane obeyſance, it ſerued rather to waſte their ſubſtance, and conſume their men, then to be an helpe and ſupporter of the Romane Empyre, in regard of the continuall warres that they had with the <hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Perſians:</hi> and therefore this Coaſt is not to be accompted among thoſe ſeauen Prouinces before ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>Now, as touching theſe ſeauen heads of the firſt Beaſt, that of <hi>Italie</hi> was the chiefe: And as for this, it was firſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerrunne and rent from the Empyre, and ſo wounded by the <hi>Gothes,</hi> that it might iuſtly haue ſeemed to haue been quite

               <p>Well, wee haue heard the one head of this Beaſtiall Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre, to haue been ſore wounded, namely, that which was in <hi>Italie.</hi> For all the Romane Emperiall dignitie, which was contained within the border of <hi>Italie,</hi> was for a while by the <hi>Gothes</hi> turned topſie-turuie: but not long after it was there agayne reuiued by the induſtrie of an other Beaſt, that is, the Pope and Romane Antichriſt: as after in this treatiſe ſhall more fullie appeare.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, to drawe to an end, by the third Beaſt, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is prefigured, which did put life into that other mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Beaſt, ſo ſore wounded in the head, that is, framed, formed, and ſet on foote the Image of that old Idolatrous Romane Empyre, ſuch as it was while it kept at <hi>Rome.</hi> For this head and horne of the Empyre, which I ſay was Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous: when once the Emperours themſelues began to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Goſpell, and to plant themſelues at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> it was wounded euen to the death, and in all likelihood diſpatched for euer.

               <p>Laſtly, the verie phraſe or manner of writing in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation,</hi> is wondrous like to that in <hi>Daniell, Cap. 3.</hi> which ſeemeth of purpoſe to be affected by the Spirit of God, leaſt perhaps we ſhould thinke that in both places, one, and the ſelfe-ſame thing were not meant.</p>

Why? may ſome ſay, did euer the <hi>Pope</hi> cauſe men to worſhip any of the Romane Emperours, ſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe that were Idolatours? Whereunto I aunſwere, that by the name of <hi>Image,</hi> (which by him is quickned) not the perſons of the Emperours are ſignified that made their abode at <hi>Rome:</hi> but rather by that name was meant and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified the State &amp; fourme of the Romane Empire (I meane, the Italiſh, and Idolatrous Empire) the which being ſtarke dead, the <hi>Pope</hi> hath againe raiſed and made whole in euery point. For euen at this houre the kingdome of Poperie doth as liuely repreſent the ould ſtate of Idolatrie, as if it were ſpit out of the mouth of it, the which euery man may eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by the comparing of them both together, and by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall inſtances which héereafter inſue.</p>
               <p>The ſtate and condition of the Romane Empire, as well as of all other Kingdomes, relieth vpon two ſpeciall and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall grounds, whereof, the one reſpecteth Religion, and the ſeruice of God, the other outward and humane pollicie, that is, the well ordering &amp; guiding of the common wealth it-ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Touching Religion, and the ſeruice of God, I pray ye what a manner of thing was it in the Romaine Empire being Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian and Idolatrous, that is, ſo long as <hi>Rome</hi> was the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion place where the Emperours kept? it was wholly Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous, and more wood and furious in infinite ſuperſtitions,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:11444:26"/> then any Nation of the world beſide, (whatſoeuer <hi>Dioniſius Halicarnaſſeus,</hi> an Heathen, in his ſecond Booke of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, doth thinke and giue out to the contrary.) And euen ſo in the Papacie, there was, and is, (as after ſhall appeare) as groſſe and outragious Idolatry, as euer was heard of. In both of them there were vſed Proceſſions, purging by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, Holy-water, Praiers, and Sacrifices for ſoules de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and Candles ſet vp in the worſhip of the dead.</p>
               <p>Concerning the gouernment or pollicie of the Idolatrous Romane Empire, it conſiſted both of matters eſſentiall, and accidentarie. I call ſuch eſſentiall, as without which, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth can not ſtand, ſuch as theſe thrée are.</p>

               <p>Accidentall, I tearme thoſe, on the which, the ſafetie, and proſperous ſtate of the weale publike doth not depend, as, the vniformitie of one language, the attire of the bodie, the Citie, where the Princes Pallaice is ſeated.</p>
               <p>Now the Romane kinde of gouernment or pollicie, at ſuch time as <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote his <hi>Reuelation,</hi> was, to ſee to, Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craticall, in reſpect of the authoritie of the Senate, but in very deede it was a deteſtable tirannie, and ſauadge kind of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, by meanes of the abſolute power and authoritie, which one only Prince and Emperour had ouer all.</p>
               <p>And euen ſo in the Antichriſtian and Popiſh Iuriſdiction, the fourme of gouernment ſeemes to be Ariſtocraticall, as, wealded by the aduiſe and direction of the Beaſt, but in plaine truth, it is a plaine tyrannie. For, there is but one that hath a maine and deadly ſtroke in all matters, namely, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who hath to meddle in euery matter, and at whoſe becke all men muſt bowe, like ſlaues and peaſaunts. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it is that I gather and conclude, that in reſpect both of Church-matters, and alſo of ſuch as concerne the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, Antichriſt reuiueth, and reſtoreth vnto vs the Image
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:11444:27"/> of that Beaſt that was ſo deadly wounded, that is, of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and Italian Empire, which was ſo fowly defaced, and brought to confuſion. Now let vs go on, and conſider of the Magiſtrates of that Empire being yet Italian &amp; Idolatrous.</p>
               <p>The Magiſtrates at <hi>Rome</hi> were of two ſorts: Supreme, and Inferiour. The ſupreme Magiſtrate was, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. And he, contrarie to the receiued cuſtome of all other Nations, tooke vpon him to be both a King and a Prieſt. For in all other places, almoſt, theſe two offices are ſeuered, and adminiſtred by diuers: As indeed the office of a Prieſt, and of King are diſtinct, and diuers. But, the Romane Emperour not content with theſe two dignities, which are the higheſt vnder the coape of heauen: tooke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him yet a third, &amp; became alſo a <hi>Tribune</hi> of the people, and that not annuall, but ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and perpetuall: Inſomuch as this one high Romane Magiſtrate (ſo long I ſay as the Empyre was Idolatrous and kept it ſelfe in <hi>Italie</hi>) held in his hand at once, theſe thrée, the greateſt and mightieſt prerogatiues: namely, the Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne kingdome and power ouer all, the high Prieſthood and chiefe ſtroake in matters of religion; and the peremptorie po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of a <hi>Tribune,</hi> whereby he might at his pleaſure nippe in the head, all decrees whatſoeuer the other Magiſtrates were diſpoſed to haue eſtabliſhed. To conclude, he ſo handled the matter, as that he might be coumpted to containe in himſelfe a kinde of <hi>Deitie, to bee Sacred, not to bee touched, moſt holie, not to be reproued or comptrouled, vnuiolable.</hi> Now the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> being the higheſt in that State, made as bould to vſurpe and incroach vpon theſe three So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignties, namely, the ſuper-eminent power and rule ouer all (for he, forſooth, is to be ſuppoſed farre aboue all Iuriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, himſelf hauing power to cenſure them) the high Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, as arrogating to himſelfe libertie to eſtabliſh what he liſt in religion. And laſtly, the ſtately <hi>Tribune-ſhip,</hi> whereby he likewiſe became ſacred, free from all men (without touch of Beaſt) exempt from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptroulement, &amp; laſtly, one that ſets in foote among the decrées and procéedings of other Biſhops.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:11444:27"/>
               <p>Touching the inferiour Magiſtrates of <hi>Rome,</hi> they were, the Senate, or bench of Aldermen, the Lieutenants of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, and ſuch others, who had not in their power any So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraign authoritie of the Empyre, but only ſuch Iuriſdiction, as by way of commiſſion was giuen vnto them from the high Magiſtrate, the Emperour. And euen ſo in the kingdome of Poperie, the Cardinalles ſtood in ſtead of a Senate, or bench of Aldermen, for Church matters: For they, and only they, forſooth, are ſayd to make a Romane Conſiſtorie. Then the Archbiſhops and Biſhops, were as it were Lieutenaunts of ſeuerall Prouinces: and laſtly, ſuch other like hauing delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie power from the Pope, but no ſupreme authoritie in themſelues, but fetch it from him whom alone they make the fountaine or wel-ſpring, in whom they ſay all Eccleſiaſticall power doth conſiſt, which from him floweth and is deriued vnto others: And as for thoſe others, they do receiue it from him, as riuers from the head, in whom all fulnes doth conſiſt. Laſtly, who is ſo ignorant that ſeeth not that the diſtinct of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Biſhops, and Metropolitanes, touching both their places of reſidence, and liberties of function, were deuiſed in way of imitation of that Romane Empyre, inſomuch as the Metropolitanes Sea, muſt needs be there where ſometimes the Lieutenaunts of the whole Prouinces made their aboad. For thus much <hi>Anacletus</hi> himſelfe, a Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth in his ſecond Epiſtle; as alſo all thoſe Canons do the like, which are extant <hi>9. quaeſt. 3.</hi> in the Popes Decrees. So it falleth out likewiſe in this reſpect, that Antichriſt and that Romane route, hath ſet vp agayne the whole Image, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of that <hi>Italiſh</hi> and Idolatrous Empyre.</p>
               <p>Let vs talke of Lawes: wherein I ſayd the third eſſentiall poynt of politicall regiment conſiſted. The Romane Lawes what kinde of ones they were vnder the Emperours, for the deſcicion of priuate controuerſies, appeareth out of the <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dects,</hi> compiled by <hi>Tribonian,</hi> as alſo out of the <hi>Code</hi> of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian, Theodoſius,</hi> and thoſe bookes that are intituled <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. In like ſort the Papiſtical lawes, ſuch as were directed
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:11444:28"/> for the taking vp and ending of matters in debate, were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Decretall Epistles</hi> (in reſemblance of the Emperiall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts) being indeed nothing elſe, but an imitation, repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; poore fourbiſhing of the very Romane lawes, practiſed vnder the olde Idolatrous Emperours: which will appeare euident, to as many as ſhall reade them, and euen their owne Canoniſtes acknowledge no leſſe: for I will not further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large this matter, by heaping vp further proofes in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. Thus much therefore touching the eſſentiall poynts of the Romane pollicie, the which in euery reſpect doth very trimly fit and agree, with the regiment and adminiſtration practiſed in the kingdome of Antichriſt and Poperie.</p>
               <p>Now let vs take view of thoſe parts which I tearmed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall: for euen thoſe alſo are reuiued and ſet on foote by the Papacie. And thoſe accidentarie poynts are eſpecially three, as is before ſpecified: whereof the firſt is the Latin tongue.</p>
               <p>Touching which language, the Romane Emperours cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it by decree to preuaile and beare rule in all matters iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciarie: inſomuch as all ſentences definitiue in cauſes iudiciall (euen among ſuch people and nations (ſo farre as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh iuriſdiction ſtretched) as were vtterly ignorant in that tongue) ſhould be deliuered &amp; giuen out in the Latin tongue: (as is to bée ſeene in the <hi>L. praetor. D. de re iudicat.</hi>) So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the Papiſticall and Antichriſtian gouernment, this tongue only plaies <hi>Rex</hi> among them, although notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Greeke and Hebrew, are farre to be preferred before it, both in reſpect of worthineſſe, and for the commendation of antiquitie.</p>
               <p>The ſecond accidentall poynt, is, the attire of the bodie. And as for the attire vſed at <hi>Rome,</hi> it was in olde time of two ſorts, either common and vſually worne, or elſe proper to certaine perſonages: as Emperours, Magiſtrates, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>The common and publike attire vſed of all; was a Gowne and a Cap (no Hat) whereupon <hi>Virgill</hi> wrote thus. <hi>The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes; rulers of the world were clad in Gownes:</hi> whereas
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:11444:28"/> the <hi>Grecians</hi> did vſe a ſhort Cloake for the attire of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and Corkt ſhooes for their feete. So in the Papacie, a Gowne is their garment, and a Cap the attire of the head, and that as it were a peculiar and proper ornament for their Prieſts. But in the Law of God the <hi>Leuites</hi> were enioined to weare Hats. <hi>Exod. 28.40.</hi> So then, nothing is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in Popery, then a Gowne, or more comely and trimme in their opinions. To conclude, they made accoumpt of a Gowne, to be an habite meete only for Worſhipfull perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: but as for a Cloake, they coumpted it vnſeemely, baſe, and a kind of diſcredit to weare it: euen as (on the other ſide) it was ſometime highly accoumpted of among the Phariſies, as our Sauiour doth ſignifie <hi>Mark. 12.38.</hi> The officers of <hi>Rome,</hi> being at any time ſent with commiſſion into any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, went attired with a kinde of Coate-armour:<note n="*" place="margin">Or an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haughts attire.</note> which was a garment like vnto a ſouldiers or trauailers Cloake, ſhort, and ritchly beawtified: by which enſigne, as it were of honour, Magiſtrates were diſcerned from thoſe that were in their retinue, or that ſerued in the Campe. Euen ſo vnto Metrapolitanes, and Arch-biſhops, in the pride of Popery, was alotted by lawe a roabe (like vnto a Coape) ſee <hi>Titull. de vſu pallij in Decretalibus,</hi> becauſe they forſooth reſemble the Lieutenants of ſeuerall Prouinces, who, as they had vnder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many Shires, &amp; inferiour officers, ſo the Archbiſhops had vnder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many Dioceſſes, &amp; Biſhops, whome they call their Suffraganes. Laſtly, other Magiſtrates of the ſaid Romane Idolatrous Empire, as namely, the Senatours ware as an enſigne of honour, a garment called <hi>Latus Clavus,</hi> which was a roabe powthered with purple ſtudds: but as for the veſture called <hi>Dalmatica,</hi> none but the Emperour might weare that. So in the Popiſh prelacie, ſuch as beare office in the Church, &amp; are more venerable perſons then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt, haue their Stoales, which is a garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as like vnto the Senatours <hi>Latus Clavus</hi> as may be: but their <hi>Dalmatica</hi> (as they alſo tearme it) no Clearke of the Church muſt be ſo bold as weare it, not the Deacons, no nor the Biſhops themſelues, without a ſpeciall
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:11444:29"/> diſpenſation from the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> their great Emperour, no more then any might weare Purpure, the Emperours royall roabe, or the <hi>Dalmatica,</hi> ſaue only ſuch, as to whome the Emperour vouchſafed ſo much by expreſſe graunt, (as appeareth <hi>Can. communis Diſt. 23.</hi>)</p>
               <p>There remaineth to ſpeake of the place where the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Court, and Metropolitanes Chaire were planted. That of the Emperours was in <hi>Italie,</hi> and euen in <hi>Rome</hi> it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as beeing then vnlawfull for the Emperours, (while they remained Idolatrous) to keepe the Emperiall Court elſe-where, then in <hi>Rome.</hi> So alſo in the Papacie, the Sea and Metropolitane Chaire of that Kingdome is in <hi>Italie,</hi> and euen <hi>Rome</hi> is the appointed place for it, neither is there any Citie in the world beſides, which may iuſtly be reputed the right ſeate for Antichriſt, or meete Sea for the Biſh. of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which things being ſo, as namely, ſith we ſee ſo many points of agreement and reſemblance betweene the Romane Idolatrous Empire long ſince defaced, and this kingdome of Poperie newly erected: who may once make doubt that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt is he, who vnhappely reuiued and reſtored the Image of the fifth Beaſt ſo deadly wounded, that is, of the Romane Empire, which was Italian and Idolatrous? And who can iuſtly deny that the Papiſticall ſeate is the very rig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

But certaine it is, that this obſeruation agreeth fitly with that of the <hi>Reuel. cap. 16.13. &amp; 19.20.</hi> where the chiefe inſtrument of this Apoſtacie is called by a kinde of prerogatiue <hi>The falſe Prophet:</hi> as if he, among all the falſe Prophets that euer were, ſhould be the moſt daungerous and deteſtable. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, the Beaſt it ſelfe, vnder whoſe figure and ſhape, the condition and manner of this defection, is by the Spirit of God reueiled vnto vs; is ſayd to bee full of names of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, whordome, and vncleannes, <hi>Reuel. 17.3.4.</hi> the which in mine opinion, no man may iuſtly make doubt, but that it is to be referred vnto the name and doctrine of Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore this place ſeemeth to require this at mine hands, that for the better vnderſtanding of this poynt, and the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner proofe of mine aſſertion: I ſhould ſpeake of, and handle the doctrine of Antichriſt, and compare it briefly with the doctrine
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:11444:30"/> of the Goſpell. And in this poynt we ſhall the better proceede if we ſhall beare in minde theſe two things.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that this Antichriſt, of whom I ſpeake, is ſuch a fellowe as aſſaulteth and ouerthroweth, not only one poynt of Chriſtian doctrine (as many Heretikes in time paſt did, as namely, <hi>Simon, Valentinus, Marcion, Nicholaus, Cerdo, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Sabellius, Arrius,</hi> and ſuch like:) but vndermineth, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, and deſtroyeth the whole frame of Chriſtes doctrine and Goſpell: which practiſe of his is bewrayed vnto vs euen in his very name or title, as being indefinitely, or without limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tearmed in euery place where this matter is handled, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the opponent or oppoſite perſon. Other Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes are limited within the compaſſe of one or two errors of theirs, as if any denie that Chriſt is come in the fleſh, he is an Antichriſt: but a <hi>Simonian</hi> Heretike. <hi>Hymenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> were in the daies of <hi>Paule,</hi> accompted Heretikes: but that was in ſome one certaine reſpect, as namely, becauſe they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned the poynt of the reſurrection of the fleſh: Theſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men although they then beleeued and taught, yet <hi>Paule</hi> is plaine that this Antichriſt, of whom here we haue ſpoken, was not yet come. Whereby it is euident, that this man is an odde fellowe, differing from the other ſimple Heretikes, as being a more foule blaſphemour then the whole packe of them all.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, (which here I do but propound and barely affirme, purpoſing afterward to make it plaine by ſubſtantial proofes) that this ſaying of <hi>Paule</hi> concerning the oppoſition, or contrarietie of the doctrine of Antichriſt to the Goſpell of Chriſt, neither can or may be vnderſtood or taken for the ſect and religion of <hi>Mahumet.</hi> For although it be ſo, that the ſame alſo bee diſſenting and repugnant to the doctrine of Chriſt, yet neither doth <hi>Mahumet</hi> himſelfe ſit in the temple of God, neither do they that profeſſe to bee of his ſect, acknowledge themſelues to be Chriſtians, or Paſtours, or Prelates of the Chriſtian Church, (the which both Antichriſt himſelfe and his adherents do) but do openly, and profeſſedly in boaſting
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:11444:31"/> manner giue it out, that they abandon both the name and companie of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Now let vs come to conſider of ſome perticular poynts of the Papiſts doctrine (who notwithſtanding will needes be accompted the only Chriſtians and Catholikes of the world) and ſee how truely the Spirit of God hath called it a doctrine oppoſite and contrarie to Chriſt and his word. For herein the auncient writers agree with vs, in referring this ſpeach of <hi>Paule</hi> vnto the Popiſh <hi>Synagogue,</hi> that is, to that Church, which boaſteth it ſelfe: but falſely, vnder the glorious title of the true Church of Chriſt. <hi>Bernard</hi> vpon the <hi>Canticles, Hom. 33. They are the miniſters of Chriſt</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>but they ſerue Antichriſt. <hi>Hilarie</hi>
                  </hi> agaynſt <hi>Auxentius: <hi>Vnder the colour of preaching the Goſpell, he ſhall be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to Chriſt, in ſuch ſort as the Lord Ieſus ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, euen while men thinke he is preached.</hi>
                  </hi> Laſtly, <hi>Chriſostome</hi> vpon <hi>Math. Hom. 49. That wee may bee able</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>to diſcerne the doctrine of Antichriſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that, that is true and ſyncere: wee are willed to make our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre to the holie Scriptures: for</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>if wee reſpect outward names, titles, and profeſsions, wee ſhall ſee that they profeſſe themſelues to be Chriſtians.</hi> And after that he addeth: <hi>Yea, they will outwardly pretend greater cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie, and mortifying of the fleſh, then ſhall appeare to be among the true Chriſtians.</hi> The which we ſee and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to iumpe very fitly with the profeſſion of Poperie, and to paint the ſame out vnto vs in her proper colours.</p>
               <p>Well, let vs ſee the iarre and ſquaring that is betweene the doctrine of the Goſpell, and that of Antichriſt. And that is to bee found eſpecially in theſe three poynts. The firſt, touching God and his eſſence. The ſecond, concerning the matter of ſaluation and the meanes thereof. The third, the worſhip of God both inward and outward, namely, of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Lord God: the ſacred Scriptures teach vs principally, and in generall theſe three heads. The firſt,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:11444:31"/> that he is God only <hi>Mark. 12.29. Deut. 6.4.</hi> The ſecond, that he is of an heauenly nature, not conſiſting of any earthly dregges or humane corruption <hi>Act. 7.48. Iſai. 66.1.</hi> The third, that he is the King of al things, eſpecially the Lord and only maiſter of our ſoules and conſciences. <hi>1. Pet. 4.19. &amp; 1. Pet. 2.25.</hi> Whereupon theſe three concluſions will neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie followe. Firſt, that the true God cannot but hate a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Gods, or if any one bee ioyned to him as a fellowe. Secondly, that he cannot abide to be repreſented by Idolls. And laſtly, that he cannot admit of any other, to preſcribe lawes for the binding of mens conſciences.</p>
               <p>Touching mans ſaluation and the cauſes thereof, the Scripture teacheth vs theſe two principall things. Firſt, that the ſame is abſolute and perfect, perfourmed by the onely death and ſacrifice (once offered vpon the Croſſe) of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt very God and man. <hi>Heb. 9.20.</hi> Secondly, that it proceedeth freely from Gods gracious goodnes towards vs. <hi>Rom. 3. &amp; 4.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, concerning religion and the worſhip of God, the Scripture teacheth vs this in generall. Firſt, that it is to bée drawne only out of the word of God: not taken from the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and precepts of men. <hi>Math. 15.9. Deut. 12.8.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, touching the outward actions of the Church, which are ſolemne ſignes and ſeales of our ſaluation, called Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: we are taught out of the ſame word of God, that God only is the author of them. <hi>1. Cor. 11.23.</hi> And touching out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ceremonies, which are alſo a part of Gods outward worſhip: the ſame word of God would haue but few of them, ſuch as were profitable, and tended to edification, to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Wherein alſo, no part or iot of our righteouſnes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth, neither is the conſcience of a man burdened with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but only they are to bee obſerued for the decent order of the publike aſſemblie, that ſo an outward vniformitie and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe might be kept among Chriſtians, as <hi>Paule</hi> writeth. <hi>1. Cor. 10. &amp; 11.</hi> And in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galat.</hi> and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Hebr. cap. 8. &amp; 9. &amp; 10.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:11444:32"/>
               <p>But as for the doctrine of Poperie, what article ſhall wee finde there, agreeing hereunto? For as concerning that of one God: their Diuinitie hath cleane raſed out that poynt: for they haue chopped and chaunged the Maieſtie of the higheſt, and haue conueighed the ſame as it were by peece-meale vnto a number of newe vp-ſtarts and pettie-Gods of their owne. For looke how many Saincts they haue canonized, ſo many Gods haue they coyned and foyſted in, to become Lords of the earth and diſpoſers of mightie matters. Inſomuch as one hath the ruling of the raine committed vnto him: an other the diſpoſing of faire weather: the third is made maiſter of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes: and an other the reſtorer of health. And touching the heauenly eſſence and diuine nature of God: firſt, they made GOD himſelfe an earthly lumpe, when they teach that the Pope is an earthly God, and when they will needes beare vs in hand that their Waifer-cake, or cruſt of bread made of Branne, is a very true God. Secondly, they haue ſet vp a number of Idolles, which they worſhip, and appoynt men to worſhip God by, and through them: and in this poynt they ſhewed their wonderfull exceſſiue outrage. For, neuer among any Nations, no not among the <hi>Grecians</hi> (from whom they ſay this Idolatrie firſt proceeded) was there the like furious madnes ſhewed in<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap>
                  </note> Idol-worſhip, as was, and is to be found among the Papiſts. For they erect ſtill new Idolls, and yet retaine their olde: they bring in forraigners, and withal wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip their home-Gods: vnknowne and knowne Gods, they worſhip all alike: to be briefe, they like mad men, haue brought in amongſt vs the perfect ſtate of Paganiſme.</p>
               <p>And as touching our eternall ſaluation and the cauſes thereof: they, as though the worke thereof were not fully fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and perfected by the only ſacrifice of our Sauiour, do daylie celebrate and thruſt vpon vs the ſacrifice of the Maſſe for the remiſſion of ſinnes. In ſomuch as that deteſtable and horrible toy of the Popiſh Maſſe, hath cleane defaced and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the true and only meanes of our ſaluation: In ſuch ſort as men now a daies reſt not them-ſelues vpon the onlie
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:11444:32"/> death and bloud-ſhed of Chriſt Ieſus. (As for that abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Maſſe of theirs, ſome writers take it to bee the ſame which <hi>Daniell</hi> calleth <hi>Mahuzim. Cap. 11.38.</hi> but herein they are deceiued. For <hi>Mahuzim</hi> in <hi>Daniell</hi> is taken in a good ſence, namely, for the defenced Tower of <hi>Sion,</hi> and for all that coaſt of <hi>Iewrie,</hi> through which there was no paſſage: by which title the true God in that place is ſet out.) But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will not graunt that this our ſaluation proceedeth freely from the meere grace &amp; fauour of God, but will needes haue it as due to our deſarts; and that it can be compaſſed and obtained by the power of frée-will &amp; vertue of mens workes.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, concerning the Sacraments, the outward worſhip of God and Ceremonies: the wiſeſt ſort of the Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues (that I ſeeke no further nor ſpend many words in this matter) do both ſee &amp; acknowledge how therein their Church hath been inſtructed, otherwiſe then the word of God will warrant. And herein it ſkilleth not though the Papiſtes giue glorious titles to their gew-gawes, calling them déepe and profound Myſteries. It is profound ſtuffe indéede, but it is the déepe ſubtilties of Sathan, as the ſpirit of God ſpeaketh. <hi>Reuel. 2.24.</hi> For the ſpirit of God hath fore-tolde that theſe toyes ſhould be tearmed Myſteries. <hi>The Beaſt ſhal haue and beare in her forehead a name written, <hi>A Mysterie.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel. 17.5.</hi> whereby ſhe craftely couereth and cloſely broacheth her blaſphemies agaynſt God. For by this godly ſhewe and blaze of <hi>Myſterie, Secrets, &amp;c.</hi> ſhe puts vpon her vile ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, a iollie countenance of ſynceritie and godlineſſe. To conclude, whereas it is expreſſely written <hi>Reuel. 17.5.</hi> that in the forehead of the Beaſt ſhould bee written the name of <hi>A Myſterie:</hi> Experience hath prooued it true. For in olde time the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had written in the place of his<note n="*" place="margin">A round at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire of the head.</note> Bonnet, this worde, <hi>A Myſterie,</hi> euen as long ago it was appoynted that the high Prieſt ſhould haue written in the fillet of his Myter, <hi>Holineſſe to the Lord.</hi> And further, euen in that their Biſhops ware forcked or double-horned Myters: they tell vs them-ſelues, that it is done in way of a myſterie. And
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:11444:33"/> finally, euery one of thoſe Beaſts do carrie in their fore-heads that myſterie, whereof <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p>But yet obiection is made héereunto, that the <hi>Pope</hi> and all Papiſts do profeſſe the name of Chriſt. I anſwere, that euen thereby it doth much more appeare that they are the very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts of whome we héere intreate. For ſo much the more deadly foes they are vnto Chriſt, in that they take vpon them his name and doctrine, and yet quite and cleane ouerthrowe the ſame: euen as cloſe théeues, and ſecret foes are ten times more pernicious, then outward and knowne enemies.</p>

                  <hi>Papa</hi> is a fawning word procéeding from a yongling vnto his elder. And this name was ſometime giuen indifferently vnto all Biſhops, as appeareth by the Epiſtles of <hi>Sidonius Apollinaris, Gregorie</hi> the great, and of others before their time, as namely, <hi>Cyprian, Ierome,</hi> and <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in whoſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings we ſhall commonly finde Biſhops, called <hi>Papae.</hi> But in proceſſe of time, by means of claw-backs, it was reſerued on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as if he were the higheſt and loade-ſtarre of all the reſt, that is, the only Biſhop of all Biſhops, and to whom only true honour belonged.

Therefore in this place of <hi>Paule,</hi> the ſtate of Popery, not <hi>Mahumetiſme,</hi> is deſcribed, and that verie expreſſely: for the Captaine of this order, is ſaid to take vpon him the honor, power, and deitie of God him-ſelfe, and that in the midſt of the Church of God.

Some therefore do not thinke that the very expreſſe name of God is héere meant, but only that he ſhould ruſh into the office, and vſurpe and challenge to him-ſelfe the power and maieſtie of the higheſt.

                  </hi> Wherein, this is it which he foretelleth, that all they which ſhould bee ſent by the falſe Prophet, that is, by Antichriſt, to wage warre agaynſt GOD and his Saincts, which are the faithfull: ſhould aſſemble themſelues in a place which is called in Hebrewe (indeede after the common man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) <hi>Armageddon.</hi> But as it ought to bee read, <hi>Geddon-Harma.</hi> That is, where the high place was cut downe: as if ye ſhould tearme it, the <hi>Ruine of Rome.</hi> For all they that ſeeke the ouerthrowe of Chriſtes kingdome, in fauour of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, do vſually repayre to that place, where that auncient, high, and ſtately <hi>Rome</hi> ſometime ſtoode, and where now new <hi>Rome</hi> is reſtored (the very place of old ruinous <hi>Rome</hi>) together with all that coaſt, whereſoeuer any ruine appeares of that auncient <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How is it then, that, all thoſe do eſpecially reſort to this place, who perfourme ſeruice to the falſe Prophet and to the Beaſt? Marry becauſe euen by the decree and appoyntment of God, both the Beaſt and his falſe Prophet, (which is, <hi>the man of ſinne,</hi> of whom <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh) were, and ſtill are, to haue their certaine aboad in that place. Whereby we ſee that from hence wee may moſt certainly gather and conclude that Antichriſt may not ſit in any other place at a venture, but only at <hi>Rome,</hi> that is, in that very place, where ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time that auncient <hi>Rome</hi> was built, and where now are to be ſeene the ſheards and rubbage of that olde building. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath prooued this to be true: For the Pope ſitteth and dwelleth in newe <hi>Rome,</hi> as in the true and proper Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politane Chaire belonging to his Kingdome. And it is ſo
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:11444:39"/> certaine true, that <hi>Rome</hi> (which is the Metropolitane Citie in <hi>Italie</hi>) is the certaine ſeate appointed by God for Antichriſt to ſit in, that for euery choiſe of a new Prince of this Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, euery one that hath intereſt in that election, muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie repaire to that place, as it is expreſſely prouided for in the <hi>6.</hi> of the <hi>Decretalls.</hi> Laſtly, that Citie is the ſhop, where all miſcheuous counſells, and peſtilent practiſes againſt the Church of God, are deuiſed, which after are in moſt deſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner put in execution againſt the Saincts of God: and to conclude, ſhe is the Princely pallaice of the papiſticall kingdome, and of Antichriſt him-ſelfe, and that ſo limited and appointed by the full and generall conſent of all the route and rabbie of that traiterous generation. For why are the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> (who retaine ſtill their power and authoritie ouer their Antichriſtian Churches, whereſoeuer they ſhall become) more tied, to be, and ſettle at <hi>Rome,</hi> then either at <hi>Bononie,</hi> or <hi>Avenion,</hi> or <hi>Viterbie,</hi> or <hi>Paris,</hi> or <hi>Venice,</hi> the which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding are verie great and famous Cities, and in reſpect of commodities, requiſite for the maintenance of our life, and of great concourſe in way of trafficke and marchaundice, are to be preferred farre aboue <hi>Rome,</hi> or all the ſoile and territorie belonging vnto <hi>Rome?</hi> If heereunto it be ſaid, that the reaſon thereof is, becauſe the <hi>Pope</hi> is Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> I aunſwere, that they who vſe to giue diſpenſations to others, that they may be non-reſidents, and diſcontinue from their proper Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks, may become non-reſidents themſelues if they will, and, as they tearme it, deſpence with themſelues in that point, and ſo vſe their owne libertie. Againe, when as the abode of this Romane Biſhop was for the ſpace of <hi>70.</hi> whole yeares together continued at <hi>Avenion,</hi> was not the <hi>Pope</hi> in all that while Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as now he is, although he were not at <hi>Rome? <hi>Stephen,</hi>
                  </hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> what time as he made ſo often iourneys to <hi>Pipin</hi> King of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> when as he was ſo ſhrewdly moleſted by the <hi>Lombards</hi> that were deadly enemies vnto the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> when I ſay, he went ſo oft, and ſtaied ſo long in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> I truſt he ceaſed not in

Now this could not poſſibly come to paſſe, before that oulde and noble <hi>Rome,</hi> which was the place of the Idolatrous Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, was ouerthrowne. For this place is called <hi>Geddon,</hi> that is, <hi>a raſing, Harma, of the high place.</hi> And thus it could not be tearmed, but after ſuch time as that high <hi>Rome</hi> was ſackt: which was throughly performed by the <hi>Gothes,</hi> before the chaire of Antichriſt was in that place erected.

               <p>Againe, if we regard the men and the manners of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and inhabitaunts of this new <hi>Rome</hi> repaired, we ſhall finde that both they and their diſpoſition, are very fit and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeing with the kingdome of Antichriſt, the which I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould be ſet out by <hi>S.

They are principally wiſe to do a miſchiefe, but ſtarke fooles to do any good: they are hated both of God and men, as hauing offered iniurie and violence to them both.

For it is certaine that thoſe words were written thus in Hebrew <hi>Geddon-Harma,</hi> &amp; therfore according to the maner of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes, we muſt in reading the words goe from the right hand, toward the left: but the Notarie, who afterward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified the words, when they were tranſlated out of the Hebrewe, into Gréeke or Latin, following the order that is vſuall with the Gréekes and Latines in their reading, and ſo beginning at the left hand, procéeding to the right, put downe <hi>Harmageddon</hi> in ſtead of <hi>Geddon-Harma.</hi>

Now for the better clearing of this matter, we muſt thus diſtinguiſh.

               <p>This may be perceiued in the ſtate of man-kinde. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all that beare the name of men, are ſo called, for that they are creatures indued with reaſon, yet among them, ſome there are, who but in reſpect only, may ſeeme iuſtly to be ſo called, as namely, fooles, and monſtrouſly miſſhapen creatures, which rather reſemble beaſts then men. But, on the other ſide, ſome there are, who in full meaſure, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute manner, deſerue to be ſo tearmed, in regard of the perfect vſe they haue of reaſon. Againe it may be perceiued in the condition of an houſe, for where-as, (to ſpeake properly) that is to be tearmed an houſe, which conſiſteth of a roofe, walles, and foundation, framed and compact together, to with-ſtand the violence and annoyance of the weather: yet ſome houſes there are which performe not thus much in good and perfect ſort, as being faultie in the roofe, or decayed in the walles: and ſome againe there are that perfourme it fully. Therefore the former are tearmed houſes but in part, which Logicians call <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, abſolute. Now the cauſe why theſe things which be not ſo abſolute and perfect, are notwithſtanding tearmed as the other are, is this, for that theſe imperfect things haue a kinde of nature and ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in a ſort aunſwerable vnto the other perfect things whereof they beare the name. For there are moe things in the world then ſeuerall names whereby to tearme them, neither is euerie thing called with a proper or peculiar worde belonging to it, whereby it commeth to paſſe, that one and the ſelfe-ſame name is attributed vnto ſeuerall things, and yet not altogether in the verie ſame ſence. Therefore this kinde of naming is not ſingle or ſimple, (as the Schoole-men ſpeake) but double and doubtfull. And euen ſo it falleth out in the word <hi>Church,</hi> which is indifferently giuen both to the true, and falſe Church. For if we haue an eye to the true &amp; proper definition of a Church, we ſhall find that it will agree only with the true Church: the definition whereof,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:11444:44" rendition="simple:additions"/> may be this. A companie of the faithfull which ſerue God ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, and retaine among them the publike markes of their adoption, which himſelfe did inſtitute, as the ſacred word, the Sacraments, and diſcipline: whereby it falleth out, that by theſe three notes, as being her true and proper badges, the true Church of God doth conſiſt, is marked out and ſeuered from the erronious and falſe Church, to wit, by the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, which is framed as himſelfe hath ordained in his holie word, <hi>(Ioh. 10.25. My ſheepe heare my voyce)</hi> by the ſincere vſe of the Sacraments, which God himſelfe appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and laſtly, by due diſcipline and correction of manners. Looke therefore what ſocietie and companie of men haue not theſe markes among them, I meane none of them at all, it cannot bee called the Church of God: but if it haue but one of thoſe notes, then is it called a Church; but only in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. But looke what congregation retaineth moe of theſe markes, the ſame may with better right be called a Church, than that which hath fewer. Now, if we ſhall make ſearch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe markes in the ſtate of Poperie, wee ſhall finde, that the ſame may be called a Church: but only in reſpect, becauſe it obſerueth and retaineth but a very dead, and darke print of the former notes: namely, the vſe and marke of one Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to wit, Baptiſme: the which by the ſpeciall prouidence of God, remayned (touching the ſubſtance of it) vncorrupt, euen in the darkeſt time of Poperie: but touching the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents or circumſtances vſed in the adminiſtration of it, it was altogether defiled, corrupt, and prophaned. Therefore the kingdome of Poperie and of Antichriſt is the Church of God, but depending, as it were by one poore marke, and a ſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſlender thread. But as for the congregations of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, they are rightly and ſimply tearmed the true Church of God, which is by al theſe marks to be diſcerned by the world, and reſorted vnto by the faithfull. The like difference was once betweene the kingdome of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the laſt whereof was retained Circumciſion onely, leaſt that the marke of their adoption by God, ſhould be cleane put out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:11444:45"/> them. Agayne, the ſame diſcrepance is to bee ſeene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene that houſe which we vſe for our daylie manſion, where we haue our houſhold, and all things neceſſarie about vs: and betweene an olde tottering Cottage, wherein ſometime wee dwelt, but after left it and let it lye deſolate: for we vſe to call them both our houſes: but to ſpeake properly, that only is to be accompted our houſe, which preſently we inhabite, and not that which we haue in ſuch ſort giuen ouer. But hereunto ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection is made in this ſort: if Poperie be the Church of God, then is it the Spouſe of Chriſt: and if his Spouſe, then is there none other aſſemblies that may be taken for the Church of God: For no man either may or can haue two wiues: there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore it is meete ye ſhould adioyne your ſelues vnto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of the Papiſtes? Whereunto I aunſwere, that there is but one Church, (namely, that only which is the true Church of God) which is to bee reputed for the Spouſe of Chriſt: as for the other aſſemblies, they are to be compted but Harlots. And as <hi>Austin</hi> ſpeaketh <hi>lib. 1. contra. Donat. cap. 10.</hi> Whatſoeuer the aſſemblies euen of the very Heretikes and Sciſmatikes, haue among them agreeing with the word of God; that the true Church of God acknowledgeth, and challengeth as properly belonging vnto her: for all other congregations are ſo farre foorth to bee approued as they do conſent with the true Church: and ſo much to be diſproued as they diſagree from the ſame. Therefore the ſtate of Poperie, in as much as it ſwarueth from the true Church, and is flat Papiſme, may as iuſtly be tearmed the Spouſe of Chriſt, as that woman that was maried long ago, but afterwards put from her huſband for adulterie by her committed, may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his wife: who although ſhe receiued long ſince the bill of Diuorcement, &amp; that all dueties of mariage ceaſed betweene him &amp; her, yet, in regard of ſome Rings, which it pleaſeth her ſtill to weare, which were once pledges betweene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer mariage, is tearmed ſometime by the name of a wife. Therefore we acknowledge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to be moſt true, which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>Math. 24.28. Where the dead bodies are, thither will
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:11444:45"/> the Eagles reſort.</hi> So euery man ought to adioyne himſelfe to that congregation which is the Church of God: But this I ſay, that this muſt be vnderſtood of the true, &amp; not of the falſe Church: And that that is the true Church of God, wherein ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther al the former markes, or at leaſt the principall &amp; chiefe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are to be found apparant. But looke in what aſſemblies the traditions of men are vrged, in ſtead of the pure worde of God, &amp; in ſtead of his true worſhip, méere Idolatrie is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: in ſtead of the true Sacraments of Chriſt, the deuiſes of men are foyſted in (all which we ſee openly practiſed in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie:) we vtterly denie that thoſe companies are the Church of God, or that they are the ſame ſocietie whereunto Chriſt would, or willed vs to reſort. Laſtly, whereas commonly we ſay, that the promiſes of God do belong vnto the Church: that alſo we hold, is to be vnderſtood only of the true Church, &amp; at no hand either of the Papiſticall or hereticall Synagogue.</p>
               <p>Now, out of this that hath been ſayd, it is eaſily to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, that thoſe are not to be accompted Sciſmatikes, that renounce Poperie, becauſe that in ſo doing they do not depart from the true Church of God: (from which whoſoeuer ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth is iuſtly to be charged with making of a Sciſme) but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are to bee acknowledged for ſuch as haue ſeuered themſelues from that blaſphemous Apoſtacie, &amp; curſed crewe of Apoſtates: (that is, from a diſguiſed marke or vizar of the Church) in which action of theirs, they are as greatly to bee commended, as thoſe that with all ſpeede rid themſelues from filthie &amp; infectious places. But if hereunto the Papiſts make replie (as they are obſtinate in maintaining their errors) and ſay, yea, but ye were baptized in this Church of ours, why therefore are ye not either re-baptized, or els why do you not continue in, and reuerence that Church wherein ye were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and whereunto at firſt ye gaue vp your names? I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, it needeth not that we ſhould be baptized agayne, in as much as we haue once alreadie béen ſprinkled with Chriſtian baptiſme: the which Sacrament (as I haue already ſhewed) touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſubſtance &amp; material point of it, was kept &amp; conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:11444:46"/> among the Papiſtes. Therefore hauing alreadie recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Baptiſme of Chriſt, wee are not agayne to bee newe Chriſtened. <hi>Austin</hi> hath often aunſwered to this effect to the <hi>Donatiſtes.</hi> And yet notwithſtanding, wee neither might, nor may for all this, continue ſtill in the Popiſh Church: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it periurie, or Apoſtacie from him, to whom wee gaue vp our names, if we abandon their ſocieties. For in our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, (the outward ſignes whereof we receiued at the hands of the Papiſtes themſelues) wee gaue not our names to the Pope: but to Chriſt, into whoſe name alſo wee were at that time incorporate, being thence called Chriſtians: him we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, and acknowledged to be the guide of our faith, and not men, not the Pope, nor any Biſhoppe: but we, partly through the great vnfaithfulneſſe, and partly through the ignorance of our Paſtorall teachers, were (and that a great while toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) caried from our Captaine Chriſt Ieſus. And ſo in the darke ignorance of our blind vnderſtandings, by them ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted, we followed the Pope in ſtead of our Sauiour. But now hauing the eyes of our mindes lightened, through Gods gracious goodnes, we ſee and acknowledge our error. And therefore with all our hearts in ſincere affections, wee vp-ſeeke, with purpoſe euer after to ſticke to our firſt and true Captaine, to whome only wee gaue vp our names, to witte, Chriſt Ieſus. <hi>Austin</hi> in his <hi>40.</hi> treatiſe vpon the Goſpell of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſaith, we are Gods coyne: but being his monie, we were caried ſtragling from his Treaſourie: and through our fault, the print which he had ſtamped in vs was worne out. At laſt he came and refourmed that, which himſelfe before had fourmed in vs. Now I pray, call ye this treacherie for a man to vp-ſeeke his Generall, and his Banner, the which for a time through ignorance he had loſt? Or is this to be a Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate? If any man thinke this aunſwer of ours not to bee ſo currant: let him heare <hi>Austin</hi> in his ſixt treatiſe vpon the Goſpell of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſpeaking thus vnto thoſe that were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by the <hi>Donatiſts. <hi>Hold thou</hi>
                  </hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that which thou haſt alreadie receiued: it is not altered, it is only acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:11444:46"/> it is the ſtampe of my Lord and King: it ſhall bee no poynt of ſacrilege in me, I do but refourme the ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, I do not temper with the ſtampe.</hi> For ſuch as <hi>Iohn</hi> had firſt baptized, Chriſt did after admit vnto him. And by baptiſme we become their Diſciples, in whoſe name wee are baptized. <hi>1. Cor. 1.13.</hi> But if they further obiect and ſay, that, if wee denie the Papiſme to bee the Church of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath ſome corruptions: and in regarde of ſome ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiours that are amongſt them, we ſhall in ſo doing fall into the error of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> who would acknowledge no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to bee the lawfull Church of God, which had in it any imperfection or blemiſh at all: I aunſwer, that in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Poperie, wee do not reſpect the lewd demeanours and diſpoſitions of men: neither do we in conſideration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of denie it to bee the true Church of God: but wee weigh the vnlawfulnes or pollution of the thing it ſelfe, the doctrine they teach, the nature of their Church, and the very ground-worke whereupon it ſtandeth, and finding that it is not the ſame whereupon the true Church is eſtabliſhed, wee cannot yeeld, that Poperie is the true Church of God.</p>

For one <hi>Arabianus,</hi> (as <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi> reporteth in the life of <hi>Victor</hi>) affirmed and taught that

And touching this ouerthrowe of the Romane Empire, <hi>Paule</hi> hath indeede made ſome ſignification of it, but ſome-what obſcurely, and that he ſeemeth to haue done in two reſpects: firſt, for that he ſpake vnto Chriſtians, and thoſe that were not ignorant of this prophecie, and of this peece of worke: for they had heard the Apoſtles in their publike preachings in the Churches, often handling that matter, as it appeareth by their writings. Secondly, to the end that none ſhould thereby take diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: or that any daunger ſhould thereby growe vnto the Church from the Romane Emperours, for that ſome of the Chriſtians ſhould ſeeme to prognoſticate, and hartily wiſhe their deſtruction.

                  </hi> ſaith, that that time is altogether hidden, and vnknowne, and is verie ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt héerein, that neither the moneth, nor the yeare, nor the time of his comming, and of his kingdome, can be learned.

Some therefore are of another iudgement, namely, that the time is expreſſely ſet downe and determined, wherein the ſaid kingdome of Antichriſt ſhould begin: and yet euen heerein alſo ſome diſſent from others. For ſome thinke that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:11444:48"/> the yeare <hi>1000.</hi> is the prefixed time, ſome <hi>500.</hi> others <hi>400.</hi> after the birth of Chriſt: but ſéeing that all theſe, becauſe for their aſſertions they ground vpon no certaine and direct place of the holie Scriptures, but reſt only vpon doubtfull coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of their owne framing, we will take an other, and that a more ſure courſe, grounding our ſelues (except I be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) vpon a more firme foundation. For if we marke well what the Spirit of God in the <hi>Reuelation</hi> hath deliuered, we ſhall finde that the time wherein the ſtate of this Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie was to be eſtabliſhed, is expreſſely ſet downe. And that time in verie truth is not ſo much to be reckoned from the time of Chriſtes paſſion or birth, as from the time wherein this point of prophecie was reueiled vnto <hi>Iohn,</hi> which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out in the yeare <hi>666.</hi> as appeareth out of the <hi>Reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Cap. 13.18.</hi> although <hi>Irenaeus</hi> doth write, <hi>Lib. 5. cap. 25.</hi> that this place of Scripture hath bin notably corrupted, the words whereof are theſe:

               <p>I haue ſayd alreadie,<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 7.</note> that theſe words, <hi>The number of a man,</hi> are not to be vnderſtoode of any magicall or miſticall word, which by the arithmeticall computation of the letters therein compriſed, would yeeld the iuſt number of <hi>666.</hi> For this manner of noting out a time, is altogether ſtrange and vnknowne in the holy Scriptures.

               <p>Now the cauſe why they all ſtumble eſpecially vpon this ſtone, is, for that they do not attentiuely marke the verie wordes of <hi>Iohn:</hi> and yet the Spirit of God in that place ſpeaketh verie ſimplie and plainely. For after he had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tould the ſtate of Antichriſt in the ſayd <hi>13.</hi> Chapter, and alſo deſcribed what manner of one he ſhould be: he alſo in plaine ſort did ſet downe the time, wherein all thoſe things ſhould be fulfilled, namely, the yeare <hi>666.</hi> which he tearmeth the number of a man, that is a plaine number, and eaſie to be knowne, not hard to be reckoned, (euen as in <hi>Eſay, Cap. 8.1.</hi> a writing that is plaine and eaſie, is called the penne of a man,) and in ſuch ſort to be coumpted, as men vſually in thoſe dayes were accuſtomed to number. And theſe yeares beginne not at the time of Chriſtes birth, but, rather of his ſuffering, and from the time of <hi>Iohn.</hi> Therefore the Spirit of God telleth vs, that in the ſupputation of theſe yeares, we muſt vſe the ordinarie, and common kinde of reckoning then practiſed. And the reaſon why the Spirit of God is ſo carefull about aduertiſing vs héereof, is, leaſt when queſtion is made of the comming of Antichriſt, we ſhould thinke that thoſe yeares were in ſuch ſort to be coumpted, as in <hi>Daniell Cap. 9.25.</hi> where the yeares of Chriſtes comming are recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by wéekes of yeares: for we ſhould be deceiued if we ſhould take that courſe. Truth it is, that God would haue the time and comming, as of Chriſt, ſo of Antichriſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely ſet downe vnto vs, but yet both of them after a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers manner of reckoning. For the time of the comming of Chriſt, was to be coumpted among the <hi>Iewes</hi> by wéekes of yeares: but the time of the comming of Antichriſt, by a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, popular, and common kinde of numbring, ſuch as all men did ordinarily vſe. For that kinde of coumpting by weekes of yeares, is intricate, hard, and not ſo familiarly knowne vnto euerie man: but this manner of reckoning, which is, by adding of yeare vnto yeare, is vſuall, and truly, verie playne and common. God vſed the former, when he dealt with the <hi>Iewes,</hi> among whome, the number of ſeauen,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:11444:49"/> was a ſolemne matter, and religiouſly accoumpted of, and who were alreadie accuſtomed to obſerue and coumpt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie things by multiplication of ſeauen weekes, as namely, the yeares of <hi>Iubile.</hi> But he vſed this latter, beeing more common, which is done, by adding eache ſeuerall yeare, as it followed in ſucceſſion vnto that, that went next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when he had to doe with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> among whome, the Church was to be planted, and with whome, that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie of ſeauens, or weekes of yeares, were neuer knowne nor practiſed, but only this other common manner, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they onely added euerie yeare as it followed, vnto thoſe that were paſt, and went before.</p>
               <p>Againe, the Interpretours of <hi>Daniell, Cap. 9.</hi> bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother reaſon, why God, in pointing and limiting out the time of the comming of Chriſt (wherein the great comfort of the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſhould conſiſt) vſed rather the number of ſeauens, namely, to the ende that he might compare the time of their exile and baniſhment, which was, by the ſpace of ſeauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares, with the time of theyr comfort, and his mercie towards them which ſhould enſue, which was ſeauen times ſeauentie yeares, that is <hi>490.</hi> which number of yeares, thoſe ſeauentie weekes preſcribed by <hi>Daniell</hi> do amount vnto.</p>
               <p>Then after this ſort muſt we number the yeares, &amp; coumpt the time of the Beaſts comming, becauſe the Spirit of God him-ſelfe doth preſcribe vnto vs the ſame manner: whereby it falleth out, that that time wherein the kingdome and ſtate of Antichriſt began publikely, openly, and that eſpecially to be framed, and ſet vp in the Church of God, was in the yeare after Chriſt <hi>666.</hi> Although withall I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt, that after the tyme of Chriſt, there were dyuers kyndes of ſupputation of yeares in the Church of God, while ſome began to reckon at the conception of Chriſt, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers reckon at the gouernment of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and ſome againe reckon from the firſt yeare of <hi>Diocleſians</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre: but verely, I my ſelfe doe thinke, that in this place,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:11444:50"/> thoſe <hi>666.</hi> yeares are to be reckoned, both from the death of Chriſt, and from the time that this prophecie was reueiled in: and eſpecially for the more eaſie and readie reckoning, let vs beginne to reckon from the time of Chriſtes ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, ſo in the <hi>666.</hi> yeare after his Paſſion, that blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous kingdome of Antichriſt, whereof the Spirit of God had fore-warned, had openly, and euerie-where ſeazed vpon the Church of God. Moſt certaine it is, that at that verie time, and in that verie yeare, the Papiſticall and execrable Maſſe, a verie defacing and blotting out of the death of Chriſt, began euerie-where priuately in Churches to be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated in the Latin tongue, as <hi>Bale</hi> writeth in the firſt of his <hi>Centuries, Cap. 80.</hi> namely, in the time of <hi>Vita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, this number <hi>666.</hi> limited for the reueiling of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, may ſeeme to ſome to be ſo ſet by God, for that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth about the third part of thoſe two thouſand yeares, wherein ſome thinke the world ſhall ſtand and continue, from the time of Chriſt, vnto the ende of the world, only there is a little ouer-plus of yeares in this multiplication ouer and aboue the iuſt number of <hi>2000.</hi> and thoſe are to be allowed to this ende and purpoſe, that Antichriſt might haue a time wherein he ſhould raigne, and after haue a fall. But tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this which I haue affirmed of the numbring of <hi>666.</hi> yeares: how true it is, let vs now more attentiuely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For the iſſue of things, and the accompliſhment of the Prophecie it ſelfe, ought to be accoumpted an omni-ſufficient witneſſe and proofe of mine aſſertion. The which, that it may the better appeare, this I ſay, and affirme, that it is moſt certayne, and out of all controuerſie, that the ſtrongeſt bulwarke, or rather ground-worke of the Antichriſtian king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, began then publikely, and in verie deede to be layde, and to be reared vp in the midſt of the Church, when one onely man, by the publike conſent of Chriſtians, began to be called and acknowledged by the name of <hi>Byſhop of By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> or, <hi>Vniuerſall Byſhop:</hi> and this began, and that by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:11444:50"/> the authoritie and will of the Emperour himſelfe, about the yeare of our Lord ſixe hundred and foure, as is manifeſt out of Chronicles.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Boniface</hi> the <hi>3.</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> was pronounced by the Emperour <hi>Phocas</hi> (as I haue ſhewed before) vniuerſall Pope and Biſhop of all the world, and that with this prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue, that this priuiledge to him graunted, ſhould continue for euer to his ſucceſſours being Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> and there ſeated. This was done by <hi>Phocas</hi> in the firſt yeare of his raigne, which is reckoned by all Hiſtoriographers to bee the yeare of our Lord <hi>603.</hi> Neither did <hi>Phocas</hi> deale thus libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally with the Romane Biſhop for nothing: For whereas the ſaid <hi>Phocas</hi> had villanouſly murdered his predeceſſour <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritius</hi> the Emperour: by this ſo bountifull a bribe beſtowed on the Romane Biſhops (who alwaies could do much in the Citie with the people of <hi>Rome</hi>) he redeemed, and ſo recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the fauour of the people, by the helpe and commendation of the ſayd Biſhop. For before the people of <hi>Rome</hi> bare dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie hatred agaynſt this <hi>Phocas,</hi> for the butcherlie murther ſo treacherouſly perfourmed by him vpon <hi>Mauritius;</hi> and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde thereof they would none of him for their Emperour. Therefore by the induſtrie of this <hi>Boniface</hi> Biſhop, in way of recompence of ſo liberall a largis, <hi>Phocas</hi> was brought in fauour with the people of <hi>Rome:</hi> who thereupon began in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne ſort to crie, <hi>God ſaue the Emperour.</hi> It may perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture be ſuppoſed alſo, that <hi>Phocas</hi> was moued hereunto, in regard of a conſtitution of <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> (which is to be read. <hi>lib. 2. Nouella. 131.</hi>) concerning the foure holie Counſells, where the Emperour willeth the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to ſit firſt in the Synod, and the Biſhop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> after him in the ſecond place. Now, touching this priuiledge graunted by <hi>Phocas,</hi> it was afterward confirmed in a Synod aſſembled at <hi>Rome,</hi> vnder the ſayd <hi>Boniface</hi> the <hi>3. <hi>Anno 607.</hi>
                  </hi> as <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus</hi> affirmeth. The which Synod conſiſted of three ſcore and two Biſhops, thirtie Prieſts, and thrée Deacons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there was full power graunted to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:11444:51"/> ratifie and diſanull the election of other Biſhops. After that, in the Synod of <hi>Affricke</hi> (which was neere about this time, and was aſſembled vnder <hi>Conſtance</hi> the Emperour, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewe vnto <hi>Heraclius</hi>) this title and inſcription was made him: <hi>Vnto <hi>Theodor</hi> Biſhoppe of <hi>Rome,</hi> aduaunced to the toppe of the holie Apoſtolike dignitie, vnto the holie Father of Fathers, to <hi>Theodor</hi> the Pope, &amp; higheſt Prince of all Prelates: the Synod of <hi>Affricke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus then wee haue found out the foundations of this Antichriſtian Apoſtacie and periured ſtate (deſcribed here by <hi>Paule</hi>) publikelie layd, about the yeare of our Lord <hi>604.</hi> but yet wee ſee that here wants of the former number of yeares: for it is to bee ſixe hundred ſixtie and ſixe. How then? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth from that time forward the power of this kingdome and of this vniuerſall Biſhoppe, that is, of Antichriſt, began more and more to incroach, in ſo much as now, all matters appertayning to the Church of God, began to bee directed at his appoyntment. And to ſpeake brieflie, then began the increaſing, the partes and the whole conſtitution and frame of this Apoſtacie, openly in the face of the Church to be laied out, faſhioned, and ſtrengthened euen as a little Infant, which being within the mothers bellie, receiueth there the knitting together and faſhion of his members.</p>
               <p>But as yet the foule puppie (Antichriſt) was not fullie brought foorth. For hitherto the power of this vniuerſall Biſhoppe was ouer-ſhadowed by the authoritie of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre, whereunto as yet he acknowledged himſelfe ſubiect. A proofe whereof may bee this, that the election of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes of <hi>Rome,</hi> were yet now by the Emperours of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> ratified and confirmed, and the ſayd Biſhoppes were ſubiect to their cenſure and reformation, yea and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and that after the time that <hi>Phocas</hi> graunted them this priuiledge.</p>
               <p>But at laſt, after time the authoritie of the Romane Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop began to increaſe in <hi>Italie,</hi> and the Maieſtie and power of the Romane Emperour, who kept at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> began
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:11444:51"/> to quaile daylie more and more, or rather began now to bee euen at the laſt caſt in <hi>Italie:</hi> and laſtly, when at <hi>Rome</hi> the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Biſhops became the Emperours Legates or Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, or rather became caruers for themſelues, and began in their owne name, and as of their owne authoritie to meddle in Church and Common wealth matters, to diſpoſe of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and priuate affayres, and by the conſent of the people to rule the whole roaſt: then at laſt they eaſilie intreated the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinopolitan</hi> Emperours to yeeld ouer vnto them (and that by publike edict, and vnder a faire Charter) all that their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and iuriſdiction, which they had ouer the Romane Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops: And further, that they would will and commaund, that whoſoeuer hereafter were by the people and Clergie, elected Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould forth-with, without any confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof had from the Emperour, and without ſending him a ſacred Epiſtle (as they tearmed it) whereby they proteſted vnto him their loyaltie; bee reputed for lawfull Biſhoppes of <hi>Rome,</hi> and bee by and by accompted to haue all lawe in their owne hands, not ſubiect to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comptroulement or cenſure of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Whereby it came to paſſe, that now the Romane Biſhops needed not the confirmation of any, no not the conſent and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the Romane Emperour himſelfe (who then kept at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>) but euen of their owne ſwindge, as being now become their owne men, tooke vpon them that authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, power and dignitie. So that from that time forward, the ſayd Biſhops began to liue as men free from all iuriſdiction of the Emperour, that is, without the checke or reach of any man or Magiſtrate whatſoeuer: yea they began to bee compted like vnto GOD himſelfe, not to bee iudged or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into queſtion by any mortall wight. (<hi>Canon. nemini. 17. quaeſt. 3.</hi> and <hi>Canon. Nemo. quaeſt. 3.</hi>) Now this without doubt may ſeeme to bee the full height of the Antichriſtian kingdome, and without all controuerſie it is to bee ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, eſpecially conſidering that it was erected, came to light, and obtayned ſo ample authoritie at ſuch a time. And this ſo great and ouer-ſpreading power of the Romane
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:11444:52"/> Biſhop, whereby he was exempted from all cenſure and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the Empyre, was graunted firſt vnto him by <hi>Conſtantine Pogonatus</hi> the bearded, an Emperour of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> whoſe raigne is reckoned to be about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yere <hi>666.</hi> or as ſome reckon <hi>668.</hi> But yet <hi>Charles Sigonius (lib. 2.</hi> of the kingdome of <hi>Italie</hi>) had rather referre the graunt of this priuiledge vnto the yeare <hi>684.</hi> Howſoeuer it be, certaine it is that <hi>Benedict</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> was the firſt that euer vſed the benefite of this ouer-laſhing and licentious libertie. And it is an eaſie matter for a Clearke or Scriuener to miſſe in the compt of a yeare or two: which is to bee refourmed by making recourſe to the <hi>Reuelation.</hi> For it is well knowne to all men, what great diuerſitie is ſometime found among the Hiſtoriographers about the ſupputation of yeares and times, and that by reaſon that the Chriſtian Church hath not alwaies obſerued one and the ſame manner of reckoning. Therefore in ſo great a ſomme as this, it is like ynough that a few daies ſhould either be added or detracted. Whereby we ſee it now appeareth, that the kingdome of Antichriſt was framed and ſet vp the very ſame time and yeare that the ſpirit of God had fore-tould: namely, <hi>Anno Domini 666.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for the kingdome of <hi>Mahumet,</hi> it began about the yeare <hi>623.</hi> vnder the Empyre of <hi>Heraclius,</hi> and in the <hi>30.</hi> yeare of his gouernment: So that the kingdomes of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt and <hi>Mahumet</hi> differ not much touching the time of their riſing. And as for this of <hi>Mahumet,</hi> it increaſed ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilie in a ſmal ſpace, namely, within the compaſſe of <hi>32.</hi> yeres: that by meanes of his Gallies &amp; Nauie, he ſodainly brought vnder his ſubiection the greateſt part of <hi>Aſia</hi> the great, <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicia,</hi> and part of <hi>Affricke</hi> in the time of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the yonger, nephew to <hi>Heraclius. <hi>Anno Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini 655.</hi>
                  </hi> So that wee ſee, the former yeare and number of <hi>666.</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Apocal.</hi> cannot appertaine to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Mahumet.</hi> And as for the kingdome of Antichriſt, it did neither ſo ſpeedilie nor ſo eaſily ſpread it ſelfe abroad as did that of <hi>Mahumet.</hi>

               <p>YEt there is one thing more, which as it may ſeeme, may be obiected vnto that, that hath been ſpoken.

                  </hi> Yet I will ſpeake what I thinke, and which, after aduiſed conſideration had of all things, touching that place, I ſuppoſe is to be determined thereof, namely, that thoſe thouſand yeares (as is euident, moſt manifeſtly, euen by the euent) do not a whit concerne or ſet out the time of the comming of Antichriſt: but rather that they are to bee reckoned and accompted, after that the ſayd number of yeares of <hi>666.</hi> were once expired. Whereby it commeth to paſſe, that by ſucceſſion, in this ſort, of times, we haue plainlie ſet downe vnto vs, what ſhall fall out and bee perfourmed, almoſt to the ende of the world. For before the ſayd thouſand yeeres were to take place, thoſe things ſhould be accompliſhed which were ſpoken of <hi>Cap. 16.12.</hi> namely, that <hi>Euphrates</hi> ſhould bee dried vp, and a way opened for the Kings of the Eaſt to come and make inuaſion vpon thoſe Territories and Countries, which were before ſubiect to the

The which but once to thinke, is extreame impietie. Wherefore, I am ſtill of the minde I was of, and begin to reckon thoſe <hi>1000.</hi> yeares from the yeare ſixe hundred ſixtie ſixe: which two numbers being put together amount vnto one thouſand ſixe hundred ſixtie ſixe.

               <p>And (truſt me) it was iuſt ſo in the time of Poperie. (The thing it ſelfe and long experience hath prooued it to bee moſt manifeſt and true.)

               <p>Therefore this aſſertion of <hi>Paule</hi> teacheth vs thus much, that this kingdome of Antichriſt was to be raiſed vp a little at once, and not to be perfected either in a moment, or in a day or houre.

               <p>For ſo is this place to be ſet together, as that the <hi>17.</hi> verſe do immediatlie follow the <hi>12.</hi> for that there is a miſ-placing of verſes, and a renting aſunder of the Chapter, through the fault of the Printers: which alſo hath happened in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the ſame booke, as the learned <hi>Theodor Beza</hi> hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued and taught vpon the <hi>15.</hi> verſe of the <hi>16.</hi> Chapter.</p>
               <p>It ſéemeth therefore that this is meant héereby, namely, that the Beaſt ſhould receiue her ſaide power of thoſe tenne Kings for an houre, which if it were true, it would giue great ſtrength vnto the opinion of the Schoole-men. But mine aunſwere héere-vnto is, that this place of the <hi>Reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> doth not properlie appertaine vnto that Beaſt which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth Antichriſt, but rather vnto that which is a figure of the Romane Empire; and that not as it was afterward, when it was remoued vnto <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> but as it was while it remained in <hi>Italie.</hi> For it is ſaid that it ſhould come to paſſe, that before thoſe tenne Kings ſhould ariſe, which ſhould vtterlie ouerthrowe <hi>Rome,</hi> and the dignitie of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire, there ſhould tenne other appeare, (and that at one time or inſtant) which ſhould indeauour to raiſe againe in <hi>Italie</hi> the Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> and giue and reſtore vnto that firſt Beaſt her auncient Kingdome, but, ſhould nothing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile. Wherefore that place of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> is directly to be vnderſtoode of thoſe who attempted to reſtore and ſet in place the ſaid Empire, not in the Eaſt and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but in <hi>Italie</hi> and in <hi>Rome</hi> it-ſelfe: who alſo, as the Spirit of God hath ſpecified, ſhould be in number tenne, but as yet (when <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote) were not begun, or come at all: and further, ſhould ariſe, all, much about one time or inſtaunt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende for the re-eſtabliſhing of the ſayde Romiſh Empyre. After whome, tenne other ſhould ſucceede, who contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhould deuoure the ſayde Empyre, that is, ſhould vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, and from the verie foundations turne vpſide-downe, and put out the ſame.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:11444:55"/>
               <p>Therefore ouer-paſſing the opinions of other men, and ſpecially of thoſe, who thinke that thoſe tenne Kings, which ſhould fauour the Beaſt, were ſuche Emperous as liued before the dayes of the Emperour <hi>Domitian,</hi> (for theyr opinion ſwarueth cleane from the meaning of that place.) This I affirme, that this place of the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> (which is read, <hi>Chapter 17. verſe 12. and 17.</hi>) is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode of thoſe tenne Emperours and Kings, who raigned laſt of all in <hi>Italie,</hi> after ſuch time as the royall manſion of the Empire was tranſported vnto <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> at what tyme the Conſtantinople Emperours had mutch adoe ſo holde the poſſeſſion of <hi>Italie,</hi> which at laſt came to paſſe immediatly after the death and murther of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the third, that valiant Emperour that was of the bloud-Royall, about the yeare of our Lord, <hi>459.</hi>

The firſt and originall ground-workes in laying and eſtabliſhing the kingdome of Antichriſt, were three, to weete, the errours of Heretikes, the contentions of Biſhops, and the ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deuotions, and exceſſiue liberalities of Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: for ſo, that, their fooliſh and immoderate largiſſe beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vpon the Church, is rather to be tearmed; then true deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: for they were too-too ouer-laſſhing and cockering, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourers towards the Church, and chiefely, the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And touching theſe three cauſes, which I called ground-works, of the Antichriſtian kingdome, it may eaſily be perceiued, that they likewiſe were three mightie and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſteps or degrees, whereby Antichriſt by little and little reared him-ſelfe vnto that huge, and tyrannous power which afterwards he attained.</p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:11444:57"/>
               <p>And firſt, touching errours in matters of faith and religion, truth it is, that the Romane Church, yea, all the Weſterne Churches remained more pure and ſound then the Eaſterne, and thoſe in <hi>Syria,</hi> by two eſpeciall meanes, the one, for that in the Weaſt there were continuall perſecutions ſtirred vp by the Emperours of <hi>Rome,</hi> the other, for that the wits of the Weſterne men were alwayes more groſſe and dull, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it came to paſſe, that they of the Eaſterne Churches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payred often, in matters of doubt, vnto the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and required their iudgement and helpe, in condemning new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſproong Hereſies, and ſo by this meanes, the credit and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> began more and more in won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull ſort to increaſe, and be highly reputed of in the Church of God: for the many and diuers Hereſies that then were, did not only ſhake the Chriſtian faith, but made it as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter greatly doubted of, among many, in the Eaſt eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, where-by alſo they made readie way for that generall back-ſliding which after inſued. And therefore thoſe Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies are called by <hi>Chriſostome, <hi>Armies of Antichriſt,</hi>
                  </hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch, as ſprang laſt, whereby, bitter contention was rayſed, and heald, repugnaunt to the word of God, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the natures of Chriſt, and of their vnion or lincking together, of the office of Chriſt, and of the merits of our workes, ſuche as thoſe were which were ſtirred vp by <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Neſtorius, Eutyches,</hi> and <hi>Pelagius:</hi> which Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies were both moſt deteſtable, and moſt forceible, to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe the vprightneſſe of mens iudgements.

                  <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> vpon <hi>Math.

Therfore the Churches of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Eaſt ſéeing they had loſt all credit and reputation of Chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion among their neighbours &amp; countreymen at home, they intreated <hi>Symmachus,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he would by his cenſure co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne the hereſies of <hi>Acatius,</hi> ſeeing that as then the Eaſterne Biſhops had no ſuch power &amp; authoritie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their people: ſo alſo they deſired of <hi>Agapetus</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would depoſe <hi>Antimus</hi> Biſh. of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as an heretike. And to make ſhort, all Eccleſiaſticall hiſtories are plentifull in ſuch examples. This therefore was the firſt meanes, whereby the kingdome of Antich. began to get footing. The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d meanes hereof was, the continuall diſſentions, garboiles, brawles, &amp; wofull contentions of the Biſhops among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, whereby not only the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues became odious among men, but euen the doctrine of Chriſt, wherof they were the pillers, bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to grow into vtter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt. Theſe ſturs were very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon in the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne Churches, but not ſo vſuall in the Weſt, by meanes of the continuall perſecutions that were there: for idlenes &amp; long reſt, doth make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more wanton &amp; diſſolute, whereby it came to paſſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Biſhops that were thus moleſted, were glad &amp; faine to flie vnto an other Biſh. of greater cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance, wherby they might be eaſed, &amp; kept fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wrongful dealings offered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by other Biſhops. Now as for the Biſh. of <hi>Rome,</hi> he no doubt by meanes of the famouſnes of the City it ſelfe, ſeemed the moſt principal, who alſo was ready &amp; willing to yéeld his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping hand in the redreſſe of other Biſhops their diſtreſſed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates: for both <hi>Athanaſius</hi> being put out of his Biſhoppricke by the <hi>Arrians,</hi> made his repaire to the B. of <hi>Rome,</hi> as vnto a ſure refuge: &amp; after him <hi>Fabianus,</hi> &amp; before him many other did y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like, as appeareth by hiſtories, infinite it were to reckon vp all exampls in this behalf, in ſo much as in proceſſe of time this repaire vnto the Romane Biſhops in times of exigence, procured him great authoritie among all nations in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:11444:58"/> and that indéede ſo great, as that the ſaid Biſhops did there-by eaſily take occaſion to abuſe it. Where-vpon, <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard <hi>Lib. 1. &amp; 4. de conſiderat. ad Eugenium,</hi>
                  </hi> complaineth greiuouſly that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> beſtirred him-ſelfe ſo, as where-by he ſhewed that he had indéede all fullneſſe of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, but not of iuſtice, when once it began to be iuſtified by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolike authoritie, that monſtrous men, &amp; very prodigious beaſts ſhould be admitted vnto Biſhopricks, and high Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall preferments. This therefore was the ſecond degrée whereby the Antichriſtian kingdome was aduaunced. The third &amp; laſt, was the exceſſiue &amp; coying fauours, that certaine Princes, &amp; eſpecially Emperours bare to that Sea: for this third point was likewiſe a principall piller in that building, for in thoſe dayes not only all men of all ſorts contended to their vtmoſt, euen like mad men, to lade thoſe Biſhops with immoderate wealth and poſſeſſions: but euen Emperours them-ſelues heaped vpon them honours, priuiledges, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dignities belonging to the maieſtie of an Emperour, or the office of a ciuill Magiſtrate, in ſo much, as they ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the cenſure and approbation of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> both their owne Decrees, and the Conſtitutions of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods. <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> the Emperour ſent Ambaſſadours vnto <hi>Iohn</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to procure his approbation of the booke of Ciuill Lawes, which he had made, and publiſhed, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the Epiſtle prefixed before the ſaid <hi>Coade</hi> of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian.</hi> Yea, ſome Emperours haue ouer ſubmiſſie giuen it out thus, that, <hi>Their Lawes do not diſdaine in waie of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, to reſemble the holie Canons,</hi> as though (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) the maieſtie and aucthoritie of Emperiall Edicts, were farre inferiour vnto that of the Popes Decrees and Canons. And in truth, where-as thoſe Emperours did (not ſo proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently) beſtowe vppon thoſe Biſhops ſo great reuenewes: what elſe did they bring to paſſe in the ende, but only a diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of deadly poiſon in the Church? the which ſome of the Popes owne claw-backs haue written, was heard in the life of <hi>Silveſter</hi> the firſte, diſtinctly vttered in the ayre,

For vnto theſe beginnings and proceedings were adioyned other cauſes and occaſions, as hang-bies; which were neither ſmall in themſelues, nor feeble in their force: Namely, firſt the fame and renowne of the Citie of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe, which was called the head of the world.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:11444:59"/> the decaied eſtate of the Empire, and the emptie ſeate thereof being at that time tranſlated vnto <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Thirdly, the bountifull benefites of certaine Biſhoppes of <hi>Rome</hi> beſtowed vpon all <hi>Jtalie</hi> in generall, and more perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly and ſpecially vpon <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe, as teſtimonies of their loue, and pledges of their care which they had of their Citizens and ſheepe. For <hi>Leo</hi> the firſt, Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> went out and met <hi>Attilas,</hi> who was making inuaſion vpon <hi>Italie,</hi> and turned him backe, hauing pacified him with a very milde ſpeach, in ſo much as that furious Beaſt (at whoſe verie name al men trembled) being ſoothed vp; without once touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any part of <hi>Jtalie</hi> returned into <hi>Pannonia. <hi>Pelagius</hi>
                  </hi> the firſt, Biſhop likewiſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> did ſo aſſwage <hi>Totilas,</hi> a moſt cruell tyraunt, by humble ſuite and petition, as that when he had alreadie ſurprized <hi>Rome,</hi> and in great rage was deuiſing how to bring it to vtter ruine: yet he obtayned thus much of this angrie and furious <hi>Totilas,</hi> that euen <hi>Totilas</hi> himſelfe ſhould inhibite further fierings and ſlaughter to bee commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Rome.</hi> There are other great good turnes recorded of other Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> employed either vpon all <hi>Italie,</hi> as by ſending or intertayning Ambaſſadours: or els perticular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vpon <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe: which things, worthelie procured to them and their ſucceſſours, great and ſpeciall fauour, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the hands of <hi>Jtalians</hi> and <hi>Romanes,</hi> but alſo of ſtrangers and men of forraigne Nations. Whereby it came to paſſe, that for remedie agaynſt the iniuries offered of ſome officers, and Lieutenants, yea ſuch as were without the precincts of <hi>Italie;</hi> appeales were made vnto the Biſhops of <hi>Rome.</hi> So did <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhoppe of <hi>Fauſienna,</hi> call for aſſiſtance at the hands of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the firſt, Biſhoppe of <hi>Rome,</hi> agaynſt the Iudges in <hi>Affricke,</hi> which committed many things with wrong and violence.

For otherwiſe it could neuer come to paſſe that Chriſt ſhould freely beare rule ouer all. And, that a perpetuall and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting kingdome is promiſed vnto Chriſt; theſe places prooue. <hi>Pſalme 2.8. Daniell 7.14.27. &amp; 2.44. Luke 1.33.</hi> Now, this vniuerſall defection whereof I haue ſpoken, is reckoned among the chiefe and principall enemies of Chriſt and his kingdome, which he at the laſt ſhould ſubdue. <hi>1. Cor. 15.25.</hi> Wherefore it muſt needes bee that the ſame ſhould be in the ende ouercome, and trodden vnder feete. And touching the ſacred authoritie of holie Scriptures, this is moſt plaine and euident, that the moſt auncient Prophecies of the Lords Prophets, haue beate vpon this poynt, that the kingdome of Antichriſt ſhould bee ouerthrowne. <hi>Dan. 7.27. Reuelation 19.20.</hi> And laſtly, vnder the type and figure of that renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and famous <hi>Antiochus,</hi> (who is ſet out vnto vs, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent Antichriſt) the ſame matter is layd open vnto vs. <hi>Dan. 8.23.24.</hi> and in the verſes following.</p>
               <p>Therefore let vs comfort our ſelues and be of good hope, and let vs ſtand ſtiffe in this our ſtrife, for the recouerie of Chriſtes kingdome, in as much as from the Lordes owne mouth wee are aſſured, that at laſt the trueth of the Goſpell ſhall preuaile, Chriſt ſhall get the victorie, and the kingdome of Antichriſt bee cleane ſpoyled. Trueth it is, that it lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vpon many ſupporters, and is maintayned with great force, and it ſeemeth a matter of infinite labour, difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and doubt, to bring to ruine the Romane route. But who can reſiſt the will and decree of GOD? Who can
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:11444:62"/> let, that it bee not executed? Séeing there are ſo many plaine prophecies of the ouerthrowe of this kingdome. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not only to conceiue hope that it ſhall ſo come to paſſe, out of that generall rule ſet downe, <hi>Eſay 60.12.

               <p>But withall, out of this verie place, the doating dreame of the <hi>Manichies</hi> is confuted, wherein they affirmed that that originall power, which as check-mate, is oppoſite in all things vnto the true God, and to Chriſt, ſhould be of an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting continuance.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place we are to conſider by what meanes this ſo mightie and large a kingdome of Antichriſt, ſhall at laſt be diſanulled: <hi>Paule</hi> aunſwereth, that it ſhall be done by the breath of the Lords mouth. Therefore it muſt néedes come to paſſe, that the ſame ſhall be brought to nought after an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort then men thinke, or then other kingdomes be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne. For by this manner of ſpeach, or circum-ſcription, <hi>Paule</hi> ſetteth out the word of God ioyned with the true ſence and power thereof. And the reaſons that may be yéelded of this ſo ſtrange a iudgement, may be diuers: as firſt, that ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the kingdome of Antichriſt (which is a meere back-ſliding from the Chriſtian faith) did at firſt ariſe, and was afterward vp-heald by diſguiſing and deprauing of the word of God: ſo by the faithfull and ſincere publiſhing of the ſame, it ſhould be brought to ruine. Againe, ſeeing that this ſtate and condition of things is a kingdome of darkneſſe and ignorance, it muſt needes fall by the light and knowledge of the word of God, and by vertue of the truth thereof, when once it begins to ſhine. For as by the riſing of the Sunne, darkneſſe is diſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and by the dawning of the day, the night vaniſheth: ſo, the bright beames of the Goſpell breaking foorth, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and doctrine of Antichriſt muſt needes be deſcried, and wholie deſtroyed. Laſtly, <hi>Daniell 2.44. &amp; 7.27. &amp; 11.45.</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:11444:63"/> maketh no mention of any other kingdome, which ſhould be raiſed after the preaching of the Goſpell. For <hi>Daniell</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth but of foure Monarchies, after which is promiſed a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Saincts &amp; holy ones, which ſhould continue for euer: and ſo hath he made knowne vnto vs, what ſhall be the ſtate of the world, euen vnto the latter day: but the Spirit of God mentioneth not any other Monarchie which ſhould ſuccéede, and ſupplant Antichriſt and his kingdome: therefore it muſt needes be, that this laſt, euen the Monarchie of Chriſt, ſhould laſt for euer. And touching the kingdome of Chriſt, it conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and worketh mightely by the preaching of the word of God: therefore by theſe weapons, and by this meanes, the kingdome of Antichriſt is by Chriſt to be ouerthrowne. And as heere the word of God is called the breath of the Lords mouth, ſo in <hi>Eſay 4.11.</hi> by the ſpirit of his lips, is meant the word of God working effectually, becauſe the bare ſound of the word, without the ſpirit of God, is ſimply, and of it-ſelfe, of no force: therefore, whatſoeuer good is wrought in vs by the preaching of the word, is to be aſcribed wholie vnto God alone. Now, the reaſon why there ſhall not follow a fift Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie after the fourth, this (in my opinion) can not ſo iuſtly be alleadged, which notwithſtanding ſome make accoumpt of as of a very ſound one, namely, becauſe in this latter, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing ould age of the world, there can no ſuch might and force of mankinde be raiſed vp, as may be thought méete for the eſtabliſhing of a Monarchy. For vnto the erecting of the ſame great powre, were requiſite, and great pollicie for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuing thereof: both which are now wanting to the world, it being become ſo aged and crooked an ould man as it is: for it is now in his decaied eſtate, all forces of his nature being almoſt ſpent: this is their reaſon. Wherevnto to make aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, this I demaund, can not God as eaſily now rayſe vp men as ſtrong in bodie, and as politike in wit, as before he hath done, when he ſet vp the former Monarchies?

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:11444:66"/> his mouth. Other earthlie and humane Monarches haue v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed earthlie and carnall weapons, both to the raiſing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and razing of others. So did the <hi>Perſians</hi> ouer-runne <hi>Aſſyria</hi> with weapon and bloudie warre. And ſo againe did the <hi>Macedonians</hi> ſubdue the <hi>Perſians</hi> by dint of Sworde. And ſo likewiſe did the <hi>Romanes,</hi> tame, and bring vnder the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> But the Lord who at firſt made and framed the whole world, by vertue of his word, who alſo ſuſtaineth and ruleth the ſame by the power there-of, and will alſo raigne in his Church by the Preaching of his worde: and laſtly, who hath giuen vnto Chriſt a ſpirituall, not an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Kingdome: will vſe a ſpirituall ſword, the effectuall prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell, for the foiling of his foes, euen as it is in <hi>Zech. 4.6.</hi> and <hi>Eſay 9.5.</hi> For the ſaying of <hi>Lactantius</hi> is right famous, and moſt worthie of credite, which he hath in his fifth Booke, and ninetenth Chapter, <hi>It ſtandeth with good reaſon, that thou ſhouldeſt maynteyne and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende thy religion with pacience, or with death, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by keeping thy faith ſound and vpright, thou makeſt it acceptable vnto God, and gayneſt credit and authoritie vnto Religion.</hi>

                  </hi> make report.) Indeede the <hi>Marcionites</hi> were of that minde: and euen at this day ſome Anabaptiſtes, haue renewed the ſame error. But, if ſo be that the partie be ſuch, as may take warre in hand, it is not ſo of it ſelfe vnlawfull. And ſuch a partie is the Magiſtrate, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth <hi>Rom. 13.4. Luke 3.14.</hi> But here we haue in hand, to ſhewe the difference that ſhould bee betweene Chriſtes kingdome, and the kingdomes of this world. For as touching the kingdome of Chriſt, as it is of it ſelfe ſpirituall; ſo doth it vſe ſpiritual weapons, ſuch as are the word of God, the power of the Spirit, and the light of the truth. But as for politicke and earthly kingdomes, in as much as they are to regard the commodities, and haue conſideration of things belonging to this life, and are for that ende and purpoſe eſtabliſhed: they do maintaine and defend themſelues by outward weapons, by the Lords permiſſion, yea ſometimes by his expreſſe will and commaundement. And hence now ariſeth, and falleth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this poynt, that famous and profitable queſtion, ſo often handled and inquired after. Whether any man may at any time, in defence of the Goſpell, put on armour, and bend the ſword agaynſt the Papiſtes (who vndoubtedly are the ſtate, ſtay, and kingdome of Antichriſt) and vſe ſuch weapons, as are called carnall, as wee reade to haue been done in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, England, Scotland, Flaunders,</hi> and <hi>Fraunce,</hi> yea and ſo
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:11444:67"/> practiſed at this day. And this doubt may ſeeme the deeper, and increaſe the more, for that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, being now become a true and perfect Chriſtian, did notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and that by the counſaile and conſent of al the Chriſtian Biſhoppes, take warre in hand agaynſt <hi>Licinius,</hi> his fellowe and companion in the quarrell of religions namely, to the end he might giue ayd and releaſe vnto the Chriſtians, whom the other did deadly perſecute. For they were compelled by <hi>Licinius,</hi> to ſacrifice vnto Idolles, agaynſt their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>Now, I do not herein make queſtion, touching the perſons or the men themſelues, whether <hi>Conſtantinus</hi> might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, in any reſpect, wage warre agaynſt <hi>Licinius,</hi> or no, who was his fellowe-mate in the Empyre. For there is none, I thinke, that doubteth but he might, ſeeing he was a chiefe and high Magiſtrate as well as <hi>Licinius:</hi> and equals are not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect the one to the other. But now I conſider &amp; reaſon of the cauſe of warre, whether to deliuer and ſet free the Chriſtian profeſſion from perſecution, and to remoue Idolatrie, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> might iuſtly moue, and wage warre. This queſtion is ſomewhat intricate and doubtfull: for it often troubleth mens conſciences, and eſpecially by meanes of this place of <hi>Paule: The Lord ſhall deſtroy Antichriſt by the breath of his mouth.</hi> For the better vnderſtanding whereof, I muſt firſt make this diſtinction.</p>
               <p>The endes or occaſions of matters for which ſuch enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes are taken in hand: are not all of one force, nature, and degree. For ſome are proper, ſome accidentall. I call that a proper cauſe or occaſion, whereunto the drift of our purpoſed determination and indeuour tendeth, and that in ſuch ſort, as we ſeeme to reſpect it only, as though there were thereto ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned no other reaſons, or inducements, that might leade vs thereunto: as when a pined man eateth, the direct cauſe of his eating, is the ſlaking of his hunger. Accidentall I call that, which concurreth and falleth out together, with the proper and principall occaſion, but not directly or of neceſſitie: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:11444:67"/> wee do not at the firſt in our aduiſement, ayme eſpecially thereat. For though that occaſion were wanting, yet would we notwithſtanding in hand with the action: as though deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate dreſſing were not added to the meat, yet would an hung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man fall to eating. Now by this diſtinction, if we hold and make vſe of it, it will bee no hard matter to fit an aunſwere, vnto the former ſcruple or doubt. For he that maketh warre agaynſt the Papiſtes, or other Idolaters, or els agaynſt the Turkes, or Heretikes, either he doth it chiefly and only to take away their error and ſuperſtition; or elſe not: but, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as other occaſions and thoſe iuſt ones, of waging warre, went before, the which he being a Magiſtrate had an eye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: it falleth out withall, that thoſe agaynſt whom he is to proceede, bee Papiſtes, Idolaters, Turkes, or Heretikes. Truely, reformation of error and hereſies, is not well ſought for by force of armes: neither ſhould the certaintie of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doctrine ſeeme to depend vpon the vncertaine yſſue and euent of warre.</p>
               <p>Therefore, neither Chriſt himſelfe, nor his Apoſtles, do at any time teach, that force is to bee vſed agaynſt ſuch as are not well affected to the Chriſtian faith, as if that were a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and readie way to take away their error. For looke what religion is embraced vpon feare, and diſperſed by compulſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie meanes: the ſame is to be compted rather <hi>Mahumetiſme,</hi> then Chriſtian profeſſion. But, when as they that are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to religion, ſhall haue offered other iuſt occaſions of warre: as, if either the Papiſts, or Turkes ſhall breake truce, and violate the conditions of publike peace: then it falleth out that the defence and maintenaunce of Chriſtian religion, is ioyned with the quarrell of publike right and iuſtice, and ſo inforced againſt the Papiſts, or Turkes, being aliaunts, and ſtraungers from the profeſſion of Chriſt, and Chriſtianitie: but not in this reſpect for that they differ from vs in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but for that they are perturbers and breakers of the publike quiet. And ſo it commeth to paſſe, that then and vpon ſuch an occaſion, weapons are iuſtly taken in hand, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:11444:68"/> ſuch as are diſſenting from vs in profeſſion of the faith, but that is not in regard, that they are Heretikes, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latours, or Papiſtes; but in aſmuch as they are ſeditious, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbers of auncient rite, and open enemies to publike peace. And this diſtinction and cenſure is certainlie moſt true.</p>
               <p>And touching that of <hi>Conſtantinus Magnus,</hi> and of the warre that he had with <hi>Licinius:</hi> it is moſt certaine, that there had paſſed betweene <hi>Conſtantine</hi> a Chriſtian, and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinius</hi> an Heathen, certaine couenaunts and leagues for the maintenaunce of the peace of the Common wealth, and thoſe ſolemnely ratified, by the conſent of both parties: as <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> reporteth in the life of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great. The which conditions, ſeeing <hi>Licinius</hi> was the firſt that brake, when agaynſt expreſſe couenaunt, he fell to perſecuting the Chriſtians: wee cannot make doubt, but that vpon very iuſt occaſion, warre was waged agaynſt him. For among thoſe conditions this was a principall one: that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chriſtians might freely make profeſſion of their religion, throughout the whole Empyre of <hi>Rome;</hi> that their meetings ſhould be approued as lawfull aſſemblies, and that neither <hi>Conſtantine</hi> nor <hi>Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> himſelfe ſhould ſtirre vp perſecution agaynſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, in regard of their faith in Chriſt. Seeing therefore, that this firſt and chiefe poynt of their league and common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, was afterward treacherouſlie violated and broken by <hi>Licinius; Conſtantine</hi> did iuſtly and vpon good ground moue warre agaynſt him, but not as being an Idolatrous King, or to the ende to redreſſe his error which he heald of Chriſt: but to the ende that thoſe publike couenaunts, and knowne lawes of the Empyre, and perticular conditions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed vpon betweene them, ſhould bee kept in force, being it was not lawfull for either of them to violate the ſame. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people and Nations haue done the like, who in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect are ſayd to haue waged warre for the Goſpels ſake. For there were at firſt certaine couenaunts drawne, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like lawes made, and after proclaimed, by conſent of both parties, for the peace and ſafetie of the whole kingdome:
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:11444:68"/> wherein, among other things it was expreſſely prouided for, that the Chriſtian religion ſhould not be diſturbed, put out of place, or ſtopt, and that no man ſhould by any, be moleſted or ſuſtaine wrong for that quarrell. The which poynt of truce and league, in as much as afterwards it was not kept by the<note n="a" place="margin">Who hould for a principle, that <hi>Fides non eſt ſeruanda cum haereticis:</hi> by heretikes, vnderſtanding true Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</note> Papiſtes, but openly violated by them: hereupon thoſe gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous warres, which are called deadlie and ciuill, are ſtirred vp: and ſo, moſt lawfull it is to perſecute the Papiſtes with fire and ſword.

For ſome expounde it ſo, as that they refer it vnto <hi>Tigrenes</hi> and <hi>Mithridatis</hi> who made inuaſion vpon the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire.

The latter writers, refer it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to the Kinges of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Aegipt,</hi> who are ſpoken of in al that chapter. The which iudgement, and interpretation, as I doe not ſurelie reiect: ſo am I withall reſolute in this, that thoſe two Empires are tipes, and figures to the Churche, of ſuch thinges as ſhoulde befall, euen after the comming of Chriſt. Therefore this is mine opinion: Firſt that thoſe two Kingdomes (whereof <hi>Daniell</hi> ſpeaketh in the laſt place) are neither ſaid ſhould be Monarchies, neither are they ſo called, but onlie kingdomes: the which two, ſhall ouerturne, al what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhall bee left remaining, of the Romane Empire in the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:11444:71"/> South and Eaſt. And of theſe two Kingdomes or Kings, the one, ſaith <hi>Daniell</hi> ſhall come out of the South, the other from the North. And this Northerne fellowe ſhall ſtrike the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter terrour into this ſaid Monarchie. Yet both theſe Kings, or Kingdomes, ſhall with ſhippes, Chariots, and Horſemen, that is, by ſea and land, aſſaulte the fourth Monarchie; and the remnaunts thereof. And againe, either of theſe Kings ſhall ſucceſſiuelie, one after an other, lay hould vpon <hi>Aegipt,</hi> that is, ſubdue the ſame, and thereof poſſeſſe great treaſures of Gould and Siluer. Laſtlie, they ſhall poſſeſſe <hi>Lybia,</hi> that is, the Region of <hi>Cyren,</hi> and <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> which is <hi>Arabia.</hi> Theſe pointes therefore I take to be vttered by <hi>Daniell,</hi> as indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentlie touching, and concerning both the ſaid Kingdomes, but not reſpecting the fourth Monarchie, and Kingdome of the Romans. Afterward, in the <hi>44 verſe,</hi> theſe two king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes are compared together, and that of the South is ſaide ſhould be diſturbed by that of the North, which lieth Eaſtern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. So that the Southerne Kingdome ſhould be in time the firſt, and that of the North the latter. And as for both of them, they ſhoulde pitch their tents betweene two <hi>Seas,</hi> and the holie hill, that is towards <hi>Iudaea:</hi> but in the ende, they ſhall come to their ende, and finall deſtruction, and none ſhall yeald them ſuccour.</p>
               <p>Theſe things are thus ſet downe in <hi>Daniell:</hi> the which if we doe vnderſtand as ſome do expound them, of <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caeſar:</hi> they are then moſt obſcure and darke, and nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with the courſe of thinges that haue happened. But being vnderſtood as I haue directed, then are they moſt plaine, and agréeing with the iſſue of things that are done. And to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin withall, theſe thinges can at no hand bee referred to the Romans, becauſe they were firſt made poſſeſſours of <hi>Lybia</hi> and <hi>Affricke,</hi> before they ſet foote in the holie Lande, that is <hi>Judaea:</hi> (for ſo doeth <hi>Daniell</hi> according to the manner of his time, call that Region, as alſo their Neighbours and people, bordering vppon them by their peculiar names, ſuch as were well knowne in thoſe dayes: the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:11444:72"/> 
                  <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and <hi>Moabites,</hi> although his prophecie tendeth vnto thoſe times, and thoſe things, which he fore-ſheweth ſhould then be accompliſhed, when as neither <hi>Iudaea</hi> ſhould be called the pleaſant land, nor the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and <hi>Moabites,</hi> ſhould be tearmed by thoſe names: which point, we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, leaſt otherwiſe theſe titles do trouble vs, and leaſt we thinke that thoſe things where-of <hi>Daniell</hi> ſpeaketh, were to be taken, and then only to be fullfilled, while both <hi>Iudaea</hi> had as yet the promiſes of God, and the <hi>Moabites</hi> were knowne by that name or title. He ſpeaketh therefore of thoſe Regions but in that manner, and with ſuch names, as where-by in thoſe dayes they were knowne to the <hi>Iewes</hi> to whome he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. But yet the things, which he fore-telleth, were then to come to paſſe, when as neither <hi>Iudaea</hi> was any more the place of Gods reſt, nor the houſe that contained the people of God, the which at the laſt fell out and came to paſſe, after the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell was once publiſhed, and Chriſt had ſuffered death.</p>
               <p>This mine opinion is heereby confirmed, for that he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of ſuch things as ſhould fall out in the latter daies, that is, in the laſt age of the world; after the accompliſhment where-of, the Angell in the <hi>Reuel. 10.7.</hi> telleth of no time that ſhould ſucceed, that is, after the fullfilling of theſe things: there is no time prefixt or ſet downe by the Spirit of God, which we ſhould looke for. For after the voice of the ſeauenth Angell, the myſteries, or hidden things of God, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiled in the Prophets, eſpecially in this place of <hi>Daniell, Cap. 11. verſ. 40.</hi> and ſo foorth to the ende of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, are to be finiſhed. And ſo do I vnderſtand the words of <hi>Daniell, At the end of time, Cap. 11.40.</hi> as alſo, <hi>Cap. 12.9. &amp; 1.</hi> that in the laſt time, and as you would ſay, the laſt age of the world, there ſhould theſe two laſt Kingdomes ſpring vp, which heere he deſcribeth and pointeth out, where-of the one ſhould riſe out of the South, the other out of the Eaſt &amp; North. And theſe two ſhall, (as I ſaid,) quite ouerthrowe, what-ſo-euer ſhall remaine in the South and North-Eaſt of the fourth Monarchie, that is, of the Romane Empire, the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:11444:72"/> which they ſhall diſtreſſe by Sea and Land. True it is, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niell</hi> ſpeaketh of both theſe newe Kingdomes together, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them (as it were) in one word: becauſe he doth but only glaunce at, and briefly ſhut vp a ſtorie farre diſtant from his time, and the ſame very obſcure, whereas notwithſtanding they ſhould be ſeuered aſunder both in time and place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the one ſhould ariſe firſt, and the other after: as appeareth out of the very text. And that this my iudgement is true, it appeareth hereby, for that afterward theſe two kingdomes are compared together, as diſtinct and diuers, as namely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two, whereof the one is ſayd ſhould ouerthrow the other, to wit, that of the North-eaſt ſhould vanquiſh the Southern, the which alſo it ſelfe ſhould in the end meete with his end and ruine.

                  <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Italian,</hi> the <hi>Adriaticke,</hi> or the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Seas, becauſe they bend not towards <hi>Iudaea:</hi> but they are more Eaſternly, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning along all that coaſt which lieth betweene the <hi>Syriacke,</hi> or <hi>Aegaean,</hi> and the red Sea. For thoſe two Seas do border out the vpper Countries, and lie towards <hi>Iewrie</hi> (as euery man may eaſilie perceiue by Coſmographie.) And to make ſhort, <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> are ſayd to bee all that region, wherein the Lord fore-telleth theſe two kingdoms ſhould ariſe, which ſhall bring to nought the remainders of the Romane Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie: whereof the one ſhould riſe in the South, towards the Eaſt and North-eaſt. For ſo do I referre indifferently vnto either of theſe kingdomes, that which <hi>Daniell</hi> vttereth in the ſingular number. Therefore thoſe two ſhall ouerthrow the fourth Monarchie in thoſe places where they ſhall pitch their tents, and in that part of the world which is contayned betweene thoſe two Seas, namely, that called <hi>Aegaeum</hi> or <hi>Syriacum,</hi> and the red Sea, or <hi>Elaniticum,</hi> lying by South,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:11444:73"/> Eaſt, and North. Now, it was very behoofefull that the ſeate or ſoyle of theſe two kingdomes ſhould bee ſet downe, and withall that it ſhould bee expreſſed of what Seas this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie ſhould be meant, (becauſe that <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe is ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted betwéene two Seas: which notwithſtanding in this place of <hi>Daniell,</hi> is in no caſe to bee vnderſtood; and many places there are in the world which are incloſed within two Seas: as <hi>Greece, Peloponneſus, Pontus,</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> the leſſe) leaſt therefore this ſpeach ſhould bee doubtfull and paſt finding out: he hath deſcribed the whole coaſt of thoſe Countries by the ſoyles that front the ſame, and by the Seas that are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning. And agayne, the very knowledge of Geographie doth ſhewe in what coaſts, and places of the world this ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe ſhould bee perfourmed by theſe two Kings or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes that ſhould ariſe: not aſſuredly in the Weſt ſhall this ruine of the fourth Monarchie be brought to paſſe, but in the South and North, or rather North-eaſt.</p>
               <p>For, as for the Romane Monarchie, it had (as I haue ſaid) two principall heads: the one lying Eaſternly at <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> the other Weſterne in <hi>Italie:</hi> wherevpon the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours themſelues did ſo deuide the iuriſdiction among them, that the one ſhould bee Emperour and keepe his reſidence in the Eaſt, the other in the Weſt.</p>
               <p>And ſo alſo doth the Scripture make the like deuiſion. <hi>Zech. 14.8.</hi> That portion and head of the Romane Empyre that I called Eaſterne: contained al whatſoeuer the Romane Monarchie had lying in the Southerne regions, in the Eaſt; among the <hi>Scithians,</hi> or the Northerne people dwelling ſomewhat toward the Eaſt. And that other Weſterne or <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Empyre, poſſeſſed all the other Prouinces. Now, this <hi>Italian</hi> Empyre was ouerthrowne by the <hi>Gothes,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales,</hi> as I haue ſhewed before, and that long before the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe of the Eaſterne, almoſt ſixe hundred yeares. But as for the Eaſterne or <hi>Constantinopolitane</hi> Empyre, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained of the Romane Monarchie: it was long after, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, about the ende of all things, and in the latter and olde age
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:11444:73"/> of the world, ſomewhat ſhaken by the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and at laſt cleane ſhiuered by the <hi>Turkes.</hi> And vndoubtedly, in mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, theſe bee thoſe two Kings here ſpoken of by <hi>Daniell.</hi> Whereof the one came out of the South, namely the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens;</hi> the other from the North-eaſt, to wit, the <hi>Turke.</hi> And theſe two people or Nations, the <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Turkes,</hi> did ſo ſpread and ouer-flowe vpon the face of the earth (as <hi>Daniell</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>verſ. 40.</hi>) that they cleane trampled vnder-foote whatſoeuer remained of the fourth Monarchie, either in the Eaſt, North, or South, the whole Weſterne part being by others long before ouer-runne: In ſo much as in all <hi>Aſia, Syria, Pontus, Aegipt,</hi> there doth not now ſo much as a print, or the leaſt marke appeare of the maieſtie and power, which the Romane Empyre once ſuſtained.</p>
               <p>And touching the ruine and ouerthrowe of this peece or part of the Romane Monarchie, or rather of this that lay Eaſternlie, than of the other occidentall Empire: God would haue it fore-ſhewed by <hi>Daniell</hi> to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> becauſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that inhabited the Eaſternlie head of the ſayd Romane Monarchie, were better knowne to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> then thoſe of the Weſt, which dwell beyond the <hi>Syriacke</hi> Sea, and ſo were remoued farre of: neither had they as yet done any harme vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Jewes.</hi> As for the ouerthrow of the <hi>Italian</hi> or occidentall Empire, it is plainly reueiled in the <hi>Apoca.</hi> So that by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of both theſe together, I meane of <hi>Daniell</hi> and the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> we haue made knowne vnto vs whatſoeuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetnes the decay, either of the orientall and <hi>Constantinopoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane,</hi> or the occidentall and <hi>Italian</hi> Empyre, or whatſoeuer elſe is behoofefull for vs to know for our comfort touching the ſtate of the world, either in the Eaſt or Weſt parts, euen to the end thereof.</p>
               <p>Now let this mine expoſition be compared with the euent or iſſue of things, which is the beſt interpretour that can be of diuine Prophecies, neither can the Spirit or true Prophet of God report an vntroath. This is it therfore which I affirme (which both is true and hath teſtimonie from ſtories) that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:11444:74"/> Conſtantinopolitane or Eaſterly head and Empyre, which remained of the fourth Monarchie, was firſt impoueriſhed by the <hi>Saracens,</hi> in that part of the North which looketh towards the Eaſt: but afterwards being made to ſtoope, (as more ſhrewdlie handled by them and brought to a low ebbe) it was quite daſht and defaced by the <hi>Turkes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We know by the Romane hiſtories, that there were dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and continuall warres betweene the <hi>Constantinopolitane</hi> Emperours and thoſe of <hi>Parthia,</hi> and after with the <hi>Perſians</hi> who did ſucceede the <hi>Parthians.</hi> For after the death of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the great, when as for a while the <hi>Parthians</hi> had liued vnder the obeyſance of his ſucceſſours, namely, the ſonnes of King <hi>Saleucus:</hi> they then began, vnder the conduct of <hi>Arſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> by plucking their necke out of yoke, to enfraunchize them ſelues into libertie, and to reare vp a kingdome among them, calling the Kings of the <hi>Parthians, Arſacides,</hi> after the name of their firſt Captaine. Theſe raigned vnto the time of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> ſonne of <hi>Mammaeus,</hi> Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to the fourth yeare of his kingdome, which was in the yeare after the birth of Chriſt <hi>228.</hi> In which very yeare one <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> a <hi>Perſian,</hi> killed <hi>Artabanus</hi> King of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> the laſt of the race of the <hi>Arſacides.</hi> This man therefore ſnatching to himſelfe the Empyre and kingdome of <hi>Parthia,</hi> conueighed it vnto <hi>Perſia.</hi> And the poſteritie of this <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Empyre, continued vnto the daies of <hi>Heraclius</hi> the firſt, Emperour of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which was in the yere of Chriſt ſixe hundred thirtie ſixe, and ſo laſted in the whole almoſt thrée hundred twentie nine yeares. About this time now began the kingdome and Empyre of the <hi>Saracens.</hi> For in the daies of <hi>Heraclius</hi> and <hi>Mahumetes</hi> raigned <hi>Syrochas</hi> the laſt <hi>Perſian</hi> King ſaue one: at whoſe hands <hi>Heraclius</hi> by compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, recouered whatſoeuer his Aunceſtours had at any time before taken from the Empyre of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> So theſe two kingdomes of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> which mutually ſucceeded each other, were terrible indeede for the time, as appeareth by hiſtories, vnto the Romane
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:11444:74"/> Monarchie, and to the <hi>Conſtantinopolitane</hi> Emperours: but yet they neither ſacked, nor greatly ſhaked the Eaſterne, or <hi>Conſtantinopolitane</hi> Empire: nay, the Emperours of <hi>Constantinople</hi> heald it out luſtely with them at euen hand, and ſtoutly made their part good againſt them. But the firſt batterie that made the ſaid <hi>Conſtantinopolitane</hi> Empire to ſtoupe, was (as I ſaid) in the Eaſt, South, and North, perfourmed by the <hi>Sarracens,</hi> who make the firſt of theſe two Kingdomes, ſpoken of by <hi>Daniell,</hi> which was to riſe from the South, and ſo ſpread it-ſelfe ouer the face of the earth, in ſuch ſort, as it ſhould aſſaile the fourth Monarchie, both by Sea and by land, in <hi>Aſia, Syria,</hi> and the North-Eaſt. And in truth, the <hi>Sarracens</hi> did ſo ſore annoy the ſaid Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne Empire, that it was neuer able afterwards to recouer it-ſelfe, but began there-vpon by little and little to droupe and drop away: for they with great expedition, euen like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ouer-ranne <hi>Syria, Cilicia, Cappadocia,</hi> and <hi>Meſopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> all which prouinces, they puld and poſſeſt from the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinopolitane</hi> Emperours: where-in, the verie words which <hi>Daniell</hi> vſeth, <hi>Cap. 11.40.</hi> ſpeaking of the Kingdome of <hi>Sarracens,</hi> are to be obſerued. <hi>This nation</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall come and ſhall ouerflowe and paſſe ouer, and ſhall ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delie ouer-runne the countries of the Eaſt and South:</hi> for ſo was it perfourmed by them, after a verie ſtrange and miraculous manner, and with wonderfull expedition (as the words of <hi>Daniell</hi> being ioined and ſet together, do purport) like vnto that ſpeach of <hi>Iulius Caeſar, I approacht the place, I viewed it well, and got the field:</hi> as if they did flie, and were not ſtopt in their paſſage, either by defenced Cities, or deapth of Seas, or force of men: for within the compaſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of threeſcore yeares, the <hi>Sarracens</hi> became poſſeſſours of all the Eaſt, as alſo of <hi>Aegipt.</hi> Againe, they ouer-ranne all <hi>Affricke,</hi> and laſtly, tooke view of <hi>Spaine,</hi> &amp; of whole <hi>Fraunce:</hi> only the weſterne people (excepting only a part of <hi>Spain</hi>) theſe <hi>Sarracens</hi> did rather aſſay then ſubdue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but as for thoſe of the Eaſt and South, which pertained to the <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politane</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:11444:75"/> Empire, by force and armes they made a plaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of them, and heald them in ſubiection, as namely, <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt,</hi> and alſo <hi>Lybia,</hi> which is <hi>Cyrene,</hi> where-in for a great ſpace they bare rule: in ſo much as at that time the <hi>Sarra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens</hi> hauing ſlaine <hi>Hormiſda,</hi> the laſt King of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> defaced vtterly the mightie <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire. They alſo made inuaſion vpon <hi>Iudaea,</hi> and that pleaſant land, which <hi>Daniell</hi> calleth the place of deſire, and grieuouſly afflicted the ſame, for as then was <hi>Iudaea</hi> ſubiect vnto the chriſtian Emperours, to wit, thoſe of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> In ſuch ſort, as they heald the ſame in their poſſeſſion a long time as they did <hi>Aegipt,</hi> and enioyed the gold, ſiluer, and all the treaſures that were to be deſired of thoſe nations by the ſpace of <hi>192.</hi> yeares, and vnto the yeare of our Lord <hi>1051.</hi> what time they were themſelues vanquiſhed by the <hi>Turks.</hi> Nowe that the <hi>Sarracens</hi> are a Southerne people, there is no man that is ignorant. Thus therefore ſtandeth that which <hi>Daniell</hi> affirmeth of the firſt kingdome, which ſhould ouerthrowe the Romane and fourth Monarchie, and that in the Eaſt and South. And this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous ſtuxre happened in the world, and came from the Southerne coaſt there-of, where-as the Countries of the <hi>Agarens, or Sarracens</hi> do lye.</p>
               <p>Further, this kingdome of the <hi>Sarracens</hi> pitched his tents betwéene thoſe two Seas, the <hi>Syriacke,</hi> and the red Sea, where of <hi>Daniell</hi> ſpeaketh: for they kept their princely pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laice, and chiefe prouinces in that part of the world, which is incloſed within theſe two Seas. And where-as heere obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made, that the <hi>Sarracens</hi> had two Emperiall places of abode, the one at <hi>Babylon,</hi> the other in <hi>Cairus,</hi> which was <hi>Memphis,</hi> a Citie of <hi>Aegipt:</hi> it maketh no matter. For the chiefe and principall regions of their Empire, lay in that coaſt which is incloſed with thoſe two Seas. Againe, their chiefe kingdome and longeſt regiment was in <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Arabia,</hi> which by <hi>Daniell</hi> is called <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> where is the Citie <hi>Meſchita,</hi> and the temple or ſepulchre of that abhominable <hi>Mahumet.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:11444:75"/>
               <p>But now we are to talke of the <hi>Turks,</hi> to the end that this whole place of <hi>Daniell,</hi> which no doubt is verie darke and obſcure, may be made manifeſt. For theſe make that ſecond Kingdome, which was to riſe out of the North-Eaſt, and which vtterly brought to nought the fourth Monarchie in the Eaſt, South, and into the other regions which were enuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the foreſaid Seas: which alſo ſet foote into <hi>Aegipt,</hi> oppreſt <hi>Iudaea,</hi> and enioyed golde, ſiluer, and the pleaſant things of the whole world, by the ſpace now almoſt of <hi>300.</hi> yeares. Theſe therefore waſted by Sea and land, with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull ſucceſſe the Eaſternely head of the ſaid fourth Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie. And theſe alſo pitched their tents, and kept their chiefe Pallaice &amp; place of reſidence in that part of the world, which is incloſed within theſe two Seas, where-of I haue ſpoken, about the hill <hi>Taurus</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi> of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the <hi>Tartarians,</hi> and before they had ſurprized <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</hi> For in that part, at firſt, the greateſt part of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire was eſtabliſhed. Now there is none that maketh doubt that the <hi>Turks</hi> are riſen of the <hi>Scithians</hi> that dwell in the Eaſt. And theſe were more terrible to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> then were the <hi>Sarracens,</hi> as alſo <hi>Daniell</hi> deſcribeth, who alſo are reported ſhould ſuccéede, and in time to come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſaid <hi>Sarracens:</hi> for the kingdome that is ſaid ſhould come out of the North-Eaſt, is ſpoken of by <hi>Daniell</hi> in the ſecond place. And this prophecie agreeth with the ſtorie of things done. For the <hi>Turks</hi> did ſuppreſſe the Empire of the <hi>Sarracens,</hi> at what time they were by <hi>Hormiſda</hi> King of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> ſtirred vp and allured out of their countries: and afterward (which alſo <hi>Dan.</hi> fore-tould ſhould come to paſſe) they were made fellow-partners of the Empire, by <hi>Mahumet</hi> the <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racen,</hi> being <hi>Sowdan</hi> of <hi>Perſia, Sogdiana,</hi> and <hi>Media,</hi> becauſe he was not able to match in power with <hi>Calipha,</hi> the <hi>Saracen</hi> of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Thus therefore the <hi>Sarracens</hi> being ſet by the ſaddle, the <hi>Turks</hi> enioyed the Empire, and raigned in <hi>Aſia</hi> &amp; <hi>Syria</hi> full out the tearme of <hi>192.</hi> yeares, but afterwards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moleſted by the <hi>Tartarians,</hi> and <hi>Aſſumbeans,</hi> Kings of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:11444:76"/> the <hi>Parthians,</hi> their power was ſome-what appalled, and almoſt brought to the laſt caſt. After that, in the yeare of our Lord <hi>1300.</hi> vnder the raigne of <hi>Romanus Diogenes,</hi> Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the houſe of <hi>Ottoman</hi> reſtored the Turkiſh Empire to his former dignitie, the recouerie where-of, was the full and finall ouerthrowe of the Eaſterne and <hi>Constantinopolitane</hi> Empire. So, the boundes of the Turkiſh Empire, are now become the very ſame, which were the limits of the Orientall Empire of the Romanes, but as for the Occidentall and Italian, he ſhall neuer ſay his fingers on it, becauſe this portion of the fourth Monarchie, ſeemeth in the <hi>Reuel. Cap. 13.12.13. &amp;c.</hi> to be allotted vnto Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. And where as it is further added in <hi>Daniell, verſ. 45.</hi> that none ſhould become an helper either to the <hi>Sarracens</hi> or to the Turks, experience hath proued it true: for God did ſo raiſe vp, and aduance theſe Kingdomes, as that they were not holpen by the power or furniture of any other forraigne nation, (nay, they were rather hated of all others) but they vſed and reſted vppon their owne only aide and prouiſion, wherein the worke of God appeareth the greater, by the ſwift and ſuddaine promotion of theſe Kingdomes. And it is ſayd of <hi>Iſmaell, Geneſis 16.12.</hi> of whome, no doubt the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens</hi> are deſcended, <hi>His hand ſhall be againſt euerie man, and euerie mans hand againſt him: he ſhall dwell in the preſence of all his brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, where-as the laſt obiection is made out of the <hi>Reuelation 20.8.</hi> touching <hi>Gog,</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> whiche ſhould conſpire with the falſe Prophet, I confeſſe I am as yet ignorant what Nation is thereby ſignified.

We haue alreadie taken viewe of the wayes where-by he attained the ſame. It pleaſed the Spirit of God, that theſe points ſhould be ſeuerally handled, to the ende that the godly ſhould be the leſſe offended, when they ſée them accompliſhed, both becauſe they are brought to paſſe by the will of God, for the triall of the faithfull, and againe their comming was fore-tolde, to ſtrike the greater terrour into the hearts of the wicked.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Paule</hi> telleth vs héere, with what aides and ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters this kingdome was heald vp and ſtrengthned, the which he maketh to be of two ſorts, the one, chiefe and principall, as, <hi>the working of Sathan,</hi> and that, mightie and effectuall: the other, inferiour, as ſeruing to the other, which he calleth <hi>Signes,</hi> and <hi>wonders:</hi> but with-all he addeth, what manner of ones they ſhould be, namely, <hi>Lying:</hi> and againe, to what ende they tended, to wit, to deceiue men, and hold them in all wickedneſſe and errour. All which points containe in them both ſingular comforts, and profitable conſiderations &amp; fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warnings of thoſe things which afterward inſued. And tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the matter of conſolations, aſſuredly they are moſt ſweete and behoouefull, ſéeing there can nothing more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table be reported, then that all thoſe things which are done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the doctrine of Chriſt, (and that to the great admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men, in ſuch ſort, as that they ſhould tearme them <hi>Miracles</hi> and <hi>Wonders</hi>) are notwithſtanding nothing elſe
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:11444:77"/> but deteſtable practiſes of Sathan, and falſe miracles. And as for fore-warnings, this place is alſo furniſht with ſuch, where-by men are enabled to perceiue how it commeth to paſſe, that all the world is ſo eaſily drawne into that errour. For where-as ſome do indeede obſerue the ſame, they wonder and are aſtonied, marueiling how ſuch a thing could ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be brought to paſſe. And in the end, thus they reſolue vpon the matter, ſaying, except the religion of Antichriſt (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede is nothing elſe but a flat blaſphemie) were the true doctrine of God, it would neuer haue bin ſo eaſily receiued, nor eſtabliſhed vpon ſuch a ſuddaine: but the aunſwere is eaſie. God had fore-tolde that all theſe things ſhould thus come to paſſe, and that he would giue ſuch power vnto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than: the which prophecie, and with-all, iuſt iudgement of God, could not but be accompliſhed. Now, why God would haue it ſo, and that vpon verie iuſt cauſe, the reaſon ſhall be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rendred.</p>
               <p>And to the ende this mine aſſertion might be throughlie ſtrengthned, I haue to alleadge a place very like vnto this, out of <hi>Math. 24.24.</hi> And againe another which is in <hi>Reuel. 16.14.</hi> And laſtly, the example of the Magitians and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunters, which reſiſted the truth, as <hi>Paule</hi> alleadgeth, <hi>2.

For ſeeing that the kingdome of Antichriſt, is in truth, a verie deprauation of the kingdome of Chriſt, but yet an imitation of the ſame, it muſt needes be, that as the kingdom of Chriſt is vpheald by theſe two things eſpecially, to wit, the doctrine of the truth, and the power of Gods ſpirit, as <hi>Paule</hi> witneſſeth, <hi>1. Theſſ. 1.5.</hi> So the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Antichriſt hath to oppoſe other two things, namely,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:11444:77"/> his errours againſt ſound doctrine, and his myracles or works of Sathan, againſt the myracles and power of the holie Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that he might caſt a myſt before mens eyes, and handle the matter ſo as he might be taken for Chriſt him-ſelfe. For ſo at laſt doth he eaſily obtaine ſo much, as that he is reputed for verie Chriſt, when as he maketh open ſhewe of the verie works of Chriſt, of his doctrine and myracles, and like a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked wretch treacherouſlie counterfaict the ſame. Therefore in ſtead of the truth, Antichriſt hath nothing elſe but lies &amp; wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked errour (wherein he doth iniurie to God) in ſtead of the power of Gods Spirit which worketh miracles, he blurteth out his wonders. For Chriſt ſending his Apoſtles, ioyned theſe two together, <hi>Mark. 16.15. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And firſt where-as <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, that the comming of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhould be by myracles: the word <hi>Comming,</hi> is to be referred not to his firſt appearing, but to the whole ſtrength, furniture, frame, and maintenance of the ſaid kingdome: for, theſe words, <hi>his comming,</hi> ſignifie thus much, his eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſtay, and ouer-ſpreading power, ſhall be atchieued by the meanes and force of Sathan, working miracles. Which two points haue indeede luſtely enlarged the ſtate of Popery, and with-all, they do very liuely point, and paint out the ſame vnto vs. For what is more common or vſuall among them, then this vaunting of infinite myracles? and what one thing do they more earneſtlie vrge and ſeeke for at our hands? Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly the <hi>Turkes,</hi> and followers of <hi>Mahumet</hi> roſe at firſt by hatching a new kind of wicked doctrine, but as for myracles, they neither boaſt that them-ſelues did euer perfourme them, neither do they require ſuch at the hands of others. But as for the Papiſts, they repoſe the top and toe, the But, and marke, and aſſured ancker-hold in the matter of myracles: and heare is it that they ſo crake of them with ſuch open mouthes, and caſt them in our teeth: ſo that Poperie can not be better deſcribed vnto vs, nor more plainely deſciphered for the verie kingdome of Antichriſt, then by this ſpeache of <hi>Paule.</hi>

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:11444:78"/> and profeſſours of the <hi>Decretalls.</hi> For my part therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing aduiſedly weighed and conſidered of all things, I take theſe three Spirits, to diſtinguiſh three chiefe and principall degrees and conditions of men, by whom, as it were by <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates</hi> and choiſe inſtruments and eſpeciall Patrones, both Poperie it ſelfe and the whole kingdome of Antichriſt was at firſt framed, erected, and enlarged, and whereby euen to this day it is cheriſhed and maintained. For whereas Chriſt had for the publiſhing of his kingdome theſe three eſpeciall degrees and orders of Miniſters, to wit, Apoſtles, Doctors, or Euangeliſtes and Biſhops: So Antichriſt hath on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide his Cardinalls, Schoole-men and Biſhops.</p>
               <p>The Cardinals of Antichriſt wil néedes ſeeme to reſemble and be anſwerable vnto the Apoſtles of Chriſt, whoſe power is to ſtretch to euery corner, and not to be limited within the precincts of any one Countrie. And as touching Doctors and the firſt Euangeliſtes, which at the beginning of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpell, were inſeperable companions of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: they are matched (a Gods name) with the Schoole-men (as they are called) that is, the whole rabble of Sophiſters, and orbet of Doctors, either ſuch as profeſſed and liued a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culare life, or a regulare, as themſelues terme it, that is, a Monkiſh or Cloyſter-life. Laſtly, concerning Chriſtian Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops; the Biſhops of the Popes orders, and of the Deuills making are in ſtead of them.</p>
               <p>And vndoubtedly all thoſe orders and degrees, are the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie pillers of Poperie, who are ſent by the Pope, or that falſe Prophet, in diuers manners and vpon ſeuerall occaſions vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kings of the earth, either as Meſſengers, or as ſimple <hi>Legates,</hi> or <hi>Legates <hi>a latere,</hi>
                  </hi> according to the qualities of the buſines that this kingdome had to diſpatch, and all of them aſſemble themſelues to warre againſt the godlie and Saincts in <hi>Geddon-harma,</hi> that is, in that place where olde <hi>Rome</hi> once ſtoode: which place aſſuredly is the very ſhoppe wherein all treaſons and practiſes agaynſt God and his annoynted, are forged.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:11444:79"/>
               <p>Now, this ſentence and interpretation of mine, is ratified by the circumſtance of the time, and by obſeruation of the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude</hi> which <hi>Iohn</hi> hath vſed, and (which is eſpecially to be obſerued in theſe Prophecies) by the very euent or iſſue of things, which is an omniſufficient witneſſe and expoſitour of this Prophecie. So then, theſe Spirits are ſayd both to bee thrée, and alſo to be diſtinct and diuers the one from the other, although they be all ſet forward by one and the ſelfe-ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor Sathan, or rather his ſonne, that deteſtable falſe prophet, that is the Pope. And as for thoſe Cardinalls, Sophiſters, and Popiſh Prelates: who can more iuſtly be ſayd to be their Sire than Sathan himſelfe? and what is their doctrine, their life, and practiſe but only deuilliſh?</p>
               <p>Further, theſe three are ſayd to be vncleane Spirits. For being that they are ſtirred vp by the Deuill, who is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane Spirit: it cannot be choſen but that they muſt bee like their father, and practiſe of his workes.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, touching the time wherein theſe things began: that alſo ſtrengtheneth and vp-houldeth my cenſure. For <hi>Iohn</hi> ſheweth that theſe began to bee ſent after ſuch time as a way was laied open, for the Kings of the Eaſt, and the riuer <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> which before time was as it were a ſacred bound-marke of the Romane Empyre in the Eaſt, and ſeuered the ſame from forraigne Nations, when <hi>Euphrates.</hi> I ſay, began to bee as it were dried vp, and to giue paſſage to the Eaſterne people, which brought vnder foote the <hi>Constantinopolitane</hi> Emperours. This people and Nation were the <hi>Turkes,</hi> and <hi>Tartarians,</hi> who being the firſt that euer paſſed ouer <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> brake vp, and as it were diſpaled the auncient limites of the Romane Empire, and ſo made in-roades and inuaſions (as I haue ſayd) into the Romane Monarchie. And this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened about the yeare of our Lord <hi>105.</hi> After which time eſpecially, the Schoole-men and Popiſh Monkes (for there were other Monkes long before that, both more holie and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to bee borne with, then thoſe that now are of the Popiſh profeſſion) began to haue Dennes and Cloyſters, as it were
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:11444:79"/> Caſtles and Block-houſes of Poperie in euery place to bee founded, built, and diſperſed, namely, after the yeare of our Lord <hi>1200.</hi> as appeareth by hiſtories. But as for Cardinals: the order of them began long ſince the other, who neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe crept vp ſince the power of the <hi>Turke</hi> began to bee ſo great, and haue obtained ſuch credite at the handes of Kings, that they can at a becke turne and winde them to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they liſt. For although <hi>Gregorie</hi> the firſt (who liued before ſuch time as the <hi>Turkes</hi> made inuaſion vpon the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empyre) in his Epiſtles <hi>15.77.</hi> and <hi>79.</hi> make mention of Cardinalls. Yet that maieſtie and power that now is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to a Cardinalſhip, is but an inuention of this later time and age: the which ſome aſcribe vnto <hi>Gregorie</hi> the <hi>11.</hi> who reduced the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> from being ſeated at <hi>Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> vnto <hi>Rome:</hi> but ſome other who do moſt fauour Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls, do attribute it vnto former Biſhoppes. Laſtly, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the name of a Biſhopricke: that aſſuredly is moſt aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, in as much as it is often ſpoken of in the holie Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as <hi>1. Tim. 3.1.2. &amp;c.</hi> But ſuch as it is now in the ſtate of Poperie, it is freſh and newe, as being brought vp long after the time of the Apoſtles, or of ſuch as liued neere after them, yea, after the daies of <hi>Bernard Clarevallenſis:</hi> in ſo much as the <hi>Audaeani,</hi> who liued in the daies of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, by occaſion chiefly of the vnwonted inſolencie of Biſhoppes, and ſuch as was neuer heard of before, ſhronke backe from the ſocietie of the Church. And aſſuredly the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoplie Iuriſdiction that now is in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is not Euangelicall, but flatly Sathanicall &amp; Deuilliſh, which hath turned all things to ambition, couetouſneſſe and pride: whereof I will ſpeake the leſſe in this place, becauſe both Maiſter <hi>Caluin, lib. 4.</hi> of Chriſtian Inſtitution Cap. <hi>7.</hi> And <hi>Charles Molinaeus</hi> in his booke <hi>Contra paruas datas,</hi> doe ſeeme to me to haue very ſufficiently handled this poynt.</p>
               <p>To conclude, the ſimilitude which <hi>Iohn</hi> vſeth in calling them Frogges, yeeldeth ſufficient ſtrength vnto this mine interpretation: for as Frogges are vncleane creatures, liuing
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:11444:80"/> in myre, full of noyſe, tedious and importunate in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall croaking: ſo alſo are theſe three orders of a very ſlut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh kinde of life, and alwaies moſt clamorous, in vexing the vertuous and Saincts of Gods: which to bee true, the very thing it ſelfe, and their importunate out-cries and inuectiues in euery place of the world againſt the aſſemblies of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, do plainly declare.</p>

Of theſe miracles, ſome are ſuch as the Papiſtes dreame are ordinarily and daylie perfourmed by their men; and ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine are ſuch, as they tell vs were long ago done about the graues of their Saincts and religious perſons: whereby a number of Superſtitions were ratified, and eſpecially that foule and blaſphemous error of <hi>praying to Saincts,</hi> as being our Mediatours, or Interceſſours to God. And of this ſorte they can reckon vs vp a thouſand. For the Papiſtes can fetch with a wet finger a miracle to perſwade any poynt they liſt, be it neuer ſo ſottiſh and repugnant to the word of God; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may perſwade fooles to giue credite to euery head and part of their erronious doctrine. The which I would largely lay open, but that their bookes are full ſtuft with ſuch toyes. But where it is added by <hi>Paule,</hi> that theſe are but, <hi>Lying miracles, wrought in all craft, and deceiuablenes of vnrighteouſnes:</hi> It is meant wee ſhould giue but little credite vnto them, and bee aſſured, that (notwithſtanding the ſame) the doctrine of Antichriſt is nothing true. For ſeeing they are but lying ſignes, and that wee are at no hand to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue lyes: we are likewiſe in no caſe to giue credite to thoſe ſignes and miracles.

For either they are falſe that are reported, or if there bee any perfourmed by Heretikes; wee are the more to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of them.</hi> Now, theſe ſignes of Sathan are called <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> in two reſpects. Firſt, in regard of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, for that for the moſt part they bee but meere illuſions:
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:11444:81"/> not the thing it ſelfe which ſeemeth to bee done, and ſo appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to the eye. Secondly, in reſpect of the ende for which they are wrought. For they are perfourmed by Antichriſt to deceiue men, and to drawe them into all kinde of impietie and vnrighteouſneſſe: As <hi>Auſtin</hi> alſo teſtifieth, <hi>lib. 20. De Ciuitate Dei cap. 19.</hi> So then by theſe two epithers or titles, all the credite is crackt of this wonderfull ſkill and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of working miracles, and whatſoeuer might thereby bee eſtabliſhed, is by the Spirit of GOD quite daſht, leaſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe by meanes thereof, wee ſhould at any time ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our ſelues to be deluded and ſeduced by Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>Now, out of all that hath been ſpoken, it is eaſie to bee gathered, that only the vnfaithfull and ſuch as do not apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the number of Gods elect, ſhall ſticke to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and kingdome of Antichriſt, who ground their faith not vpon the worde of GOD, but vpon certaine great and wonderfull miracles: and as for ſuch fellowes, it was an eaſie matter for Sathan alwaies to deceiue them.

And aſſuredlie this is the higheſt ſtep of madneſſe that can be, for men, not only like ſots to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and approue of lies in ſtead of truth; but to reſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them-ſelues there-in quietly, contentedlie, and in ioyfull ſort: yea, with ſtretched-out armes to embrace the ſame, to ſoothe and ſolace them-ſelues in it, although in the meane time their conſciences do there-in greatly grutch &amp; repine againſt it. Laſtly, the ſame <hi>Paule</hi> addeth this as an vp-ſhot, of this villanie and raging madneſſe committed againſt God, that the ſame matter which theſe men ſo greedely purſue, and ſo entirely embrace, is nothing elſe then meere <hi>Vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi> Where-in, their condemnation was the greater, and their puniſhment the more iuſt.

For as that is called righteouſneſſe, where-by we yeeld vnto God and man, that which is their due, and ſhewe our ſelues conformable to the will of God in all our actions both in-ward and out-ward; ſo is that <hi>Vnrighteouſnes,</hi> where-by we are iniurious to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:11444:84"/> God and our neighbour, ſhrinking from the will of God either in points of doctrine, or matters of life and conuerſation. The which to be practiſed and found rife in Poperie and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Antichriſt: there is none that can make doubt except ſuch as neuer ſawe the ſhadow of it, or taſted the leaſt drop of her venome.

                  <hi>1.</hi> The firſt whereof reſpecteth and reſteth vpon the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of thoſe, which both heere-tofore haue profeſſed, and as
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:11444:85"/> yet do hold the ſame Apoſtaticall; that is, Papiſticall doctrine: but herevnto the aunſwere is eaſie. For ſeeing that <hi>Paul</hi> hath very clearely deliuered this point, namely, that it ſhould fall out, that only the elect and children of God, ſhould perſeuere and continue in the true doctrine, and thoſe in number be but few; but as for ſuch as deſpiſe the Goſpell, and are ſeduced by Satan, they are almoſt infinite (for the way is narrowe that leadeth to eternall life, but broade is the pathe that tendeth to deſtruction, as our Sauiour affirmeth) there can not vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly be brought any proofe from the greater number &amp; troupe of men, to aſſure vs of the true marks of the Church, and to confirme vs in the certaintie of the truth, &amp; of the doctrine we profeſſe. For by that reaſon were the <hi>Turks</hi> now rather to be reckoned the true Church of God, then are the Papiſts, for there are moe <hi>Turks</hi> &amp; <hi>Mahumetanes,</hi> the Papiſts.

But I aunſwere with <hi>Paule,</hi> that ſo it was to fall out that this Antichriſtian, and Apoſtaticall doctrine, ſhould not only be allowed of by ſome men, but alſo be willingly receiued into the verie Church, in ſuch ſort, as that men ſhould ſecurely and wonderfully repoſe them-ſelues in it: and all becauſe that then, they tooke no due regard vnto the word of God. Therefore this reaſon faileth, as hauing in it a fallation, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:11444:85"/> that for a cauſe (as alſo the former did) which is none at all.</p>

Quae ab initio. D. de Regul.

Why may not the like priuiledge be awarded vnto the word of God (who is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings) and vnto his Church, ſo, as no preſcription of time, be it of neuer ſo long continuance, may preiudice the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? and that eſpecially, ſeeing that thoſe whiche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan firſt to take this aduauntage of time, dealt not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, nor in plaine truth, and ſimplicitie, without which,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:11444:86"/> there can no preſcription preuaile in the Church; ſo then it followeth not, that the doctrine of Popery is therefore true, becauſe it hath bin plauſibly admitted for a great while together, for <hi>Daniell</hi> and the Spirit of God haue fore-tolde it ſo ſhould come to paſſe: and therefore it could no otherwiſe fall out.</p>
               <p>To conclude, in the <hi>2. Kings, Cap. 17.41.</hi> the ſuperſtitions of the kingdome of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are condemned, and ſuch religion as <hi>Ieroboam</hi> had preſcribed, for the worſhipping of God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be affirmed to haue bin obſerued, from the Aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours vnto the children, and childrens children, and ſo foorth. And wheras men wonder how God ſhould ſuffer his Church to erre ſo long time together, the aunſwere there-vnto is eaſie and readie, that God neuer permitted his Church ſo long to be ſeduced, but only ſuffered the wicked, reprobate, and ſuch as fall from him, to wander and goe aſtray, and giue credit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to lyes, and that vpon deſert of theirs, and as I haue ſayde, moſt iuſtly on his behalfe. For although Papiſtry was neuer the true Church of God; yet in the kingdome of Popery, and in the very midſt of the Papiſts them-ſelues, God did often wonderfully preſerue his Church.</p>
               <p>Now out of all this that hath bin ſpoken, I hope not only that this place of <hi>Paule</hi> may be eaſily vnderſtood, but withall that this point is as clearely laid open out of the word of God, as the noone day.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE enterpriſe is great (right Worſhipfull and worthie) and full of doubt and difficultie, which I haue taken in hand, to affirme &amp; maintaine, and that in ſo ſolemne an aſſemblie of learned men, as this is, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who profeſſeth himſelf to be Chriſtes Vicar in earth, the ſucceſſour of <hi>Peter,</hi> the head of the Chriſtian Church, the chiefe of all Biſhops, the moſt Catholike of all Catholikes, a kinde of Oracle of religion, and a mortall God among men: to auouch I ſay, and hould, that the ſame man is the very Antichriſt, an enemie to God, a traytor to Chriſt, an aduerſarie to religion, the ring-leader of hereſies, and a murderer of Gods Church. But as ye are here preſent in bodies, ſo bee preſent in atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and if heretofore by meanes of that commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> error, which generally hath preuailed, ye could not peraduenture giue right cenſure of that wicked monſter: yet now at length, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide coniectures, thinke vprightly of the matter, and whom the Scripture hath fore-tould, time hath diſcouered, and the Church hath many ages been burdened with: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him for Antichriſt, ſpit in his face, and curſe him euen to the pit of hell. For why ſhould we not both iudge frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and ſpeake plainlie in the caſe? or why ſhould wee at all doubt, and ſtagger in a matter ſo manifeſt, and of ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? If the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> be the Antichriſt (of whom we can make no other accompt, except we will be wilfully decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) why ſhould wee either looke longer for an other, or why
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:11444:87"/> ſhould we not call this the very Antichriſt? I hope that after I haue done, none of you will doubt, but that, that iollie Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop which keepes ſuch a coyle, is the very and only Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt: in ſuch ſort as who will not bee loſt for euer, ought vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to deteſt him and abandon his ſocietie. And herein I purpoſe to deale ſo, as the right order of diſputation requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: namely, firſt, in way of confirmation, by authoritie of the Scriptures to warrant mine aſſertian, and as for ſuch argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as may ſeeme to make agaynſt me, I will not meddle with them in mine Oration. For now it is my part to make plaine and ſtrengthen the cauſe, and afterward to ſhake of the aduerſaries obiections when I ſhall come to aunſwering. And firſt to begin withal, I will take that vnto me as graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which of neceſſitie muſt bee yeelded, that Antichriſt is in the Scriptures ſet out vnto vs, by his true and infallible markes, ſo that wee are neither to imagine of any other, not ſpoken of in the Scriptures, but that wee confidently affirme him to be Antichriſt, vnto whom all thoſe things do ſo fitly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, which wee reade in the word of God concerning Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. For either it muſt needes bee ſo, or elſe the Spirit of God hath not well deſcribed him vnto vs, the which cannot be affirmed without blaſphemie.</p>
            <p>Therfore I wil ſet downe this as the ground of my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and defence, that the Scripture hath deliuered vnto vs whatſoeuer was meete for the Church to knowe, touching Antichriſt: and that he without all controuerſie, is the true (or rather the falſe) Antichriſt, in whom thoſe markes are to bee found, whereby the Spirit of God would expreſſe Antichriſt, and ſet out as it were, in his liuely and proper picture, to the view of all men. And as for thoſe things which are ſet downe in the whole bodie of the Scriptures concerning Antichriſt, I vphold that euery one of them doth agree to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that they all cannot be attributed vnto any other. Now, the name of Antichriſt is in the Scriptures taken in two ſortes, generall and proper, or perticular. For as the name of Chriſt is ſometime applied vnto all thoſe who
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:11444:87"/> haue ſome reſemblance of him in their being annoynted, (ſuch as were the Prophets, Kings, and Prieſts, in like ſence whereof the Prophet ſpeaketh, <hi>Pſalm. 104. Touch not mine annoynted</hi>) and ſometime agayne, is taken for the very Sonne of God made manifeſt in the fleſh, our redeemer and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt: So alſo in the Scriptures the name of Antichriſt is ſometime taken for euery aduerſarie of Chriſt, (as in the <hi>1. Ioh. 2. There are many Antichriſtes come al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie:</hi> that is, there begin to incroach many back-ſliders, which indeuour to corrupt the pure word of God:) and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time agayne more properly for that chiefe Antichriſt which mallapertly thwarteth Chriſt himſelfe, not only in one or two poynts, but in the whole frame of religion and kingdome of Chriſt. And euen in ſuch ſence did <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeak of Antichriſt in that very place, when he ſayth: <hi>Little children, it is the laſt houre: and as ye haue heard that Antichriſt ſhould come, &amp;c.</hi> And of this kinde of Antichriſt are thoſe things to bee vnderſtoode, which <hi>Paule</hi> writeth in his <hi>2.</hi> Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſ. cap. 2.</hi> I am not therfore to intreate of thoſe pettie and paltrie Antichriſtes, which are many in number, and ſhould ſow the ſeed of the Apoſtacie, and horrible Antichriſtianiſme, which was to inſue: but of that Captaine Antichriſt, which ſhould in all poynts bee oppoſite to Chriſt, and of whom the other were but fore-runners. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſay that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is this great Antichriſt, my meaning is, that he is the Captaine and head of that Apoſtacie, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture poynted at, and fore-ſhewed, ſhould take place in the Church. For wee are not to imagine, that the whole power of Antichriſt is included in that Biſhop only, but that pontificall kingdome which is oppoſite and contrary vnto the kingdome of Chriſt, is in truth to be tearmed Antichriſt. And ſeeing the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is the head of this kingdome: I call him An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, being but a part of the whole. Wherein I whollie followe the manner and direction of the Scripture: which, when it ſpeaketh of that Antichriſt, it mentioneth ſometime a whole kingdome and bodie, as it were, as when <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth:
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:11444:88"/> 
               <hi>Except there firſt come a defection, or falling away:</hi> and, <hi>Now the myſterie of iniquitie worketh:</hi> And ſometime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne it ſpecifieth but ſome one, being chiefe and principall in this kingdome, of whom dependeth the whole bodie of this wickedneſſe: as when he ſayth, <hi>Setting and aduauncing himſelfe agaynſt whatſoeuer is called God, or is worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and bearing it out as if he were at God.</hi> Theſe two poynts cannot bee vnderſtoode of the whole bodie, but of the head, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> himſelfe. Thus then, ſeeing it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth what I meane by the name of Antichriſt, let vs come to the matter and thing it ſelfe, and examine what we finde in the Scripture concerning Antichriſt, whereby all men which are not alreadie infected with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dregges of Antichriſtianiſme, may acknowledge and confeſſe, that the Romane Biſhop is (as I ſay) this Antichriſt. And herein of purpoſe I will affect breuitie, indeuouring to comprize many thinges in a fewe words, and much matter in a ſmall compaſſe.</p>
            <p>All the auncient Fathers, almoſt, and many of the late writers, and thoſe very learned Diuines doe affirme, that <hi>Daniell</hi> in his <hi>11.</hi> Chapter about the ende did ſpeake of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt. For the things that are there ſpoken by him, are to be referred to <hi>Antiochus</hi> only, figuratiuely, but are properly and in truth to be vnderſtood of Antichriſt. There are none of the Popes Proctours themſelues, to my knowledge, that make doubt, but that the Prophet in that place doth ſpeake of Antichriſt. Which if it be ſo, we may euen out of this place learne, who, and what manner of fellowe this Antichriſt ſhould be. For in that treatiſe of <hi>Daniell</hi> we may behold, not a ſleight counterfeit, but a liuely picture of the Biſhoppe of <hi>Rome.</hi> For firſt (ſayth the Prophet) <hi>He ſhall doe what him liſt.</hi> And indeede, the Pope hath now theſe many yeares done euen what he pleaſed in many matters, as well Ciuill as Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall. For he takes vpon him to create, tranſlate, and put downe Kings; to diſcharge ſubiects from their oath of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and to haue the like authoritie ouer al Empires and Kingdomes, to roote out, pull downe, bring to ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy:
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:11444:88"/> agayne, to build and plant them at his pleaſure. And this power he hath put in practiſe, not only heretofore againſt many Kings and Keyſers, but of late he itched, as ye knowe, to exercize vpon our gracious Soueraigne. And as for Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall matters, he therein challenged to himſelfe much more licentious libertie. For therein al his ſayings, placards, and degrees, were to bee accompted as Oracles, proceeding from the Spirit of God, whatſoeuer liked him, muſt be taken for Catholike: and whatſoeuer diſpleaſed him, was to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted hereticall. Though he ſhould drawe with him infinite ſoules of men into hell: yet it were impietie for any man to ſay, <hi>What do you? <hi>(diſt. 40. Si Papa)</hi>
               </hi> And it is an olde prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple among Papiſtes, which none of them dare denie, that the bare <hi>Will</hi> of the Pope is <hi>reaſon ynough.</hi> Further, the Prophet ſayth: <hi>He ſhal exalt and magnifie himſelfe aboue all that is God.</hi> The which alſo <hi>Paule</hi> very flatly affirmeth of Antichriſt. Now, how the Pope perfourmeth this, I ſhall afterward ſhewe, when I ſhall come to handle that place of <hi>Paule.</hi> Thirdly, the Prophet addeth: <hi>And he ſhall proſper, vntill by the wrath of God he bee brought to nought.</hi> Who is ignorant how wonderfullie the kingdome of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie increaſed, vntill ſuch time as the Lord reueiled Antichriſt vnto his people. Fourthly, it followeth: <hi>neither ſhall he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the God of his Fathers.</hi> And ſure the Romaniſtes haue deuiſed vs a newe God, which is not the true God of the Chriſtians. They haue a counterfaict God and a ſtraunge Chriſt, a newe heauen, and ſuch a religion, as our Fathers the Apoſtles neuer knewe, but ſuch an one as themſelues could inuent and frame for their owne turnes: the which I will after make manifeſt. Fifthly, the Prophet writeth, <hi>He ſhall not care for the deſires of women.</hi> The Papiſtes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they bee not the leaſt effeminate men that euer were, yet they condemne mariage as vtterly vnlawfull among them, in all their orders and profeſſions: in ſo much as they preferre abhominable Sodomitrie, and filthie raging luſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore honeſt and holie Matrimonie. Sixtly, <hi>He ſhall worſhip
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:11444:89"/> God with golde, and ſiluer, and precious ſtones.</hi> Among the Catholikes, the ſpirituall and true worſhip of God is cleane decayed, and all their religion ſtandeth in outwarde ſhewe, and ſtately furniture of their Churches and Images, and maſking pompe in celebrating their Maſſes. Laſtly, he addeth, <hi>He ſhall increaſe his glorie, and ſhall make his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſſes to rule ouer many, and ſhall deuide the land among them.</hi> What riot, what glorie, what magnificence, what power, what riches and treaſure can be greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the Papiſts poſſeſſed? Whatſoeuer was pleaſant in al Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, whatſoeuer was gainfull, delightſome, fatt, and to be deſired; was whollie (not long ſince) in the Popes fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. Wherefore, I thinke aſſuredly that no man doubteth, but that theſe things do ſo touch the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they do not agree ſo fitly with any other whoſoeuer.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing there be ſome that be not as yet reſolued, that <hi>Daniell</hi> in this place ſpake of Antichriſt; or if he did, yet, that he there ſpake but figuratiuely, as, vnder the perſon of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: let vs come to the newe Teſtament, wherein this Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian monſter is plainlie and clearely ſet out vnto vs. And yet I will not proſecute euery place, but make inſtaunce on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of ſuch proofes, as are moſt plaine and pregnant. There was neuer any Chriſtian that as yet made doubt, that in the ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſ. cap. 2.</hi> mention is made of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. Wherefore, let vs aduiſedly conſider and make ſearch into that place, and let vs compare the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> with that Antichriſt of the Apoſtle, who muſt needes bee the verie Antichriſt, that by his true and proper marks, we may learne to acknowledge the very truth of the thing. The <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> had wronglie perſwaded themſelues, that the comming of Chriſt, and the end of the world drewe neere. The Apoſtle endeuoureth to rid them of that errour, and withall deliuereth doctrine moſt neceſſarie for all Chriſtians. The ſimple and plaine propoſition whereof is this: Antichriſt ſhall come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the comming of Chriſt. This Antichriſt he diuerſlie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth, that euery Church and Congregation might knowe
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:11444:89"/> what a manner of one he ſhould bee. Let vs ſeuerally conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of each parte of this deſcription, ſet downe by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. Firſt he ſaieth, <hi>Except there come firſt a back-ſliding or falling away.</hi> Now, it is a falling from the faith that he meaneth, for his purpoſe was not to ſpeake of the chaunges of Empyres, or ouerthrowes of Kingdomes; and agayne. the worde <hi>Apoſtacie</hi> doth ſignifie no leſſe, <hi>1. Tim. 4.1.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: That is, <hi>They ſhall ſhrinke from ſound doctrine.</hi> And further, all the Fathers giue it out, that the comming of Antichriſt ſhall bee ioyned with a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ouerthrowe of religion and godlineſſe. And whereas the Apoſtle calleth it ſimplie an <hi>Apoſtacie</hi> (which ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue,) he thereby ſheweth that it ſhould bee a generall, and not a perticular defection. For he ſpeaketh abſolutely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out limitation. And this may alſo more manifeſtly appeare, by compariſon of other places. <hi>Luk. 18.8. The ſonne of man when he commeth, ſhall he finde faith vpon earth?</hi> This is that <hi>Apoſtacie</hi> and want of faith whereof <hi>Paule</hi> ſpake. <hi>Math. 24.12. Iniquitie ſhall be increaſed, the loue of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhall be colde.</hi> And <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Reuelation</hi> foretelleth, <hi>That the Kings of the earth ſhould commit fornication with the Harlot:</hi> And, <hi>that the inhabitants of the earth ſhould bee made dronken with the wine of her whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> And, <hi>that all Nations ſhall drinke of her cuppe.</hi> And laſtly, the euent of things which is the beſt expoſitour of theſe matters, doth prooue that I ſay to bee moſt true. For partly by <hi>Mahumetiſme,</hi> and partly by Poperie, faith hath been long ſince, almoſt cleane put out; in ſo much as well nigh there is no remnant left in the world, of the true and auncient faith and ſinceritie. After this, the Apoſtle beginneth to deſcribe Antichriſt by his proper markes. <hi>And that, that man of ſinne bee diſcloſed, euen the ſonne of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is an aduerſarie.</hi> In theſe words he ſetteth out Antichriſt as it were one man, who although he be not indeed any one ſingle or perticular man; yet is he by the Apoſtle deſcribed vnder the perſon of one, both in regarde of that
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:11444:90"/> kingdome which he maketh oppoſite to Chriſtes, and is one, and alſo in reſpect of that one and the ſelf-ſame ſpirit of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, wherewith all the Antichriſtes in the world are caried. As the kingdome of Antichriſt is one, ſo alſo is the kingdome of Antichriſt one; and for that cauſe as <hi>Daniell</hi> long before had laied open ſeuerall kingdomes, which were continued a long time by lineall deſcent and ſucceſſion of Kings and people, vnder the names of a Leopard, a Lion, and a Beare: ſo alſo would the Apoſtle ſet out Antichriſt, and the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the Antichriſtian kingdome, vnder the figure or reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of a moſt wicked man. And ſeeing the Biſhoply king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doth fight and contend with the kingdome of Chriſt: and ſeeing that in the ſame, the Biſhop as a principall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narche doth beare the ſway: wee rightly tearme the Pope (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) by a kinde of prerogatiue, Antichriſt. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle faith, <hi>that this man was to be reueiled:</hi> that is, ſhould openly affect and poſſeſſe a kingdome, and exerciſe his tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: the which, it is certaine the Pope hath practiſed aboue nine hundred yeares, euen euer ſince that time wherein he would needes be called the head of the Church, and take vpon him the chiefe ſtroake in the Church. And to the end we may euidently perceiue, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is that Antichriſt (as I affirme) let vs proſecute the other parts of this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall deſcription laied out by the Apoſtle. He laies open Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt in the fourth verſe following, by three adiuncts or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties: for firſt, <hi>He ſhall oppoſe and exalt himſelfe againſt al that is called God, or that is worſhipped:</hi> Secondly, <hi>He ſhall ſit as God in the temple of God:</hi> Thirdly, <hi>He ſhall ſhewe himſelfe that he is God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe wordes containe much matter in them, and offer great varietie of ſpeach: but, I of neceſſitie muſt obſerue a meane. Firſt therfore Antichriſt was to become <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> oppoſite to Chriſt, <hi>an aduerſarie,</hi> contrarie, in ſuch ſort as he ſhould aduaunce himſelfe aboue Chriſt. So that Antichriſt ſhould take vpon him, not only ciuill reuerence, but euen di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worſhip. Can any man hereof make doubt, but that this
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:11444:90"/> doth moſt fitly agree with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome?</hi> For he will needes be greater then God himſelfe, and ſetteth himſelfe full butt agaynſt him. And that he would needes be greater then God, we ſhall eaſilie perceiue; if we conſider what power and authoritie either of them do challenge to themſelues: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth only to God to preſcribe lawes, to binde our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, who only hath the ſoueraigntie ouer our ſoules. The Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> will needes beare rule ouer mens conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, (wherein he attributeth to himſelfe a diuine intereſt) yea inioyneth in more hard and ſeuere manner, then he ſuppoſeth that God himſelfe ought to do. For who knoweth not that a man might with greater ſecuritie tranſgreſſe the lawes of God, than the Popes Conſtitutions; and that he that ſhould offend the ſayd Biſhop, ſhould in more ſeuere manner ſmart for it, than he that ſhould with notorious wickedneſſe offend the Lord. To bee ſtayned with fornications, adulteries, and vnſpeakeable impieties, required no great penaunce, ſuch ſinnes could bee done awaie at a light and eaſie price; but to haue taſted once either of Porke or Beefe vpon a Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, that could neuer be wiped out, but by the bloud of him that offended: and yet the one ſtands forbidden by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and the other by none but by the Biſhop. They make it for the moſt part but a mockery or May-game to breake the lawes of God, but to tranſgreſſe the Biſhops, is right mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and deadly. To hurt God by periurie and blaſphemy they make it no great ſinne: but, to offend the Biſhop only by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuerent ſpeach, is a huge treſpaſſe, and worthy to be reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by moſt extreame torture. There are a thouſand ſuch like, wherein the Biſhop eſtabliſheth his authority to be reputed as farre more authenticall and holie, then the power of God: Then, what is it to aduance him-ſelfe aboue God, if this be not? ſhall we looke that Antichriſt ſhould plucke God out of heauen, and climbe vp into his Celeſtiall ſeate? and the ſayd Biſhop is alſo an aduerſarie vnto Chriſt, and that not in any one parcell only, but ſimply, and (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) in the whole; I will in few words make it plaine, for neither is colde more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:11444:91"/> vnto heate, or blacke to white more contrary, then is Popery to Chriſtianitie, and the Biſhops profeſſion, vnto the doctrine of the Goſpell. For what a kinde of God do they make of him, when they ſerue ſuch an infinite number of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, and fill the whole world with their Idolatrie? for where euer, either among the <hi>Graecians</hi> or <hi>Aegiptians,</hi> or the ould <hi>Romanes,</hi> were Images more common, or more frenticke i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll-worſhip, then was; and as we knowe is in the Romiſh Church? and that of a ſorie ſlender cruſt, a God can be made as ſoone as a Prieſt ſhall haue breathed out a fewe words out of his filthie mouth: I beſéech ye (brethren) what a madnes is it, and what ſacrilegious blaſphemie againſt God? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they haue no God at all, and much leſſe haue they any Chriſt, whome they haue diſhonoured, mangled, and torne in pieces in ſuch wonderfull ſort. We are taught in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that Chriſt is a man; but a man he can not be if he be infinit, without circum-ſcription or limitation of place or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſuch a Chriſt as the Papiſts haue dreamed vpon, they make Chriſt, both man and God, of that Mathematicall ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies which they vſe in their Maſſe, which is ſo ſubtile and thin, that it conteineth in it no thickneſſe at all. I would heere knowe of them, how, in that little bodie or ſubſtance, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh or ſeuer the deity of Chriſt from his humane nature. And what a kinde of bodie is that, which is of no quantitie, which can be perceiued by no ſence, which poſſeſſeth at once an infinite number of places, and thoſe farre diſtant? thus therefore they deſtroy the perſon of Chriſt, and as touching his office, they are there-in more foulie and dangerouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. For, what part at all do they héere-in leaue ſound and entire vnto Chriſt? If Chriſt be our Prieſt, and if there be two partes of this Prieſthoode, the one, that he ſhould offer him-ſelfe for our only and perpetuall ſacrifice, the other, to be our interceſſour, and make prayers for vs. How is it that the Papiſts do offer vp Chriſt euery day, and how is it that they ſuborne an infinite number of Mediatours? If Chriſt be our Prophet, why will they not ſtand content with his
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:11444:91"/> doctrine, to what ende do they require further humane lawes and traditions? If he be our King, what néede we an other Biſhop to be our King, which ſhould rule ouer our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and the whole Church of Chriſt? wherefore if he be Antichriſt that denies Ieſus to be Chriſt the annointed, as <hi>Iohn</hi> hath taught vs: it is euident that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is Antichriſt, who hath taken away the Kingdome, Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and Propheticall office of Chriſt. I can not runne ouer each place of the doctrine of the Goſpell, that therein I might ſhewe how the Biſhop is contradict vnto Chriſt, in euerie point; and theſe haue I lightly toucht, &amp; in fewe words runne ouer, becauſe I am not now to handle common places: but briefely to yeeld the reaſon of this my defence and aſſertion. Wherefore to let paſſe other points, &amp; to conclude this place, I affirme, that the whole doctrine of the Goſpell, that ſetteth out vnto vs the cauſes &amp; meanes of our ſaluation, and which preſcribeth either the outward or inward worſhip of God; is by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes meanes depraued, ſpoiled, &amp; cleane ouerthrowne: the which being ſo, it followeth, that the Biſhop is rightlie called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, an opponent or <hi>Aduerſarie. 3.</hi> And leaſt any man ſhould dreame, that Antichriſt ſhould be an outward enemy, ſuch as <hi>Mahumet</hi> is, <hi>Paule</hi> addeth, that <hi>He ſhould ſit in the Temple of God,</hi> that is, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> midſt of the Church: therefore he ſhould proue an houſhold enemy, not a forraigne foe, and ſhall withſtand Chriſt couertly, not openly, although notwithſtanding he ſhall be a deadly enemy vnto Chriſt, yet ſhall he pretend great faith, religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, friendſhip, &amp; familiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation with Chriſt, whereby we may ſee how much more dangerous an enemy he is. So the Biſh. of <hi>Rome,</hi> although he be repugnant vnto Chriſt in all things, yet hath he placed &amp; ſeated himſelf in the midſt of the temple and people of God. For he holdeth that himſelfe is the Vicar of Chriſt, &amp; that his ſynagogue is the true Church of Chriſt, &amp; that all his are the true Catholicks, and crieth out, that all ſuch as ſeparate themſelues from him are Hereticks. Thus doth he chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendge to him-ſelfe the title and name of the Churche, and detracteth it from all others; and this is it whiche
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:11444:92"/> 
               <hi>Paule</hi> meaneth, in ſaying he ſhall ſit in the midſt of Gods Church. Many ſhall come ſayth Chriſt in my name, ſaying: <hi>I am Chriſt.</hi> Now, what is it to come in the name of Chriſt; but to vſurpe the place or name of Chriſts Vicar? And this hath not only bin perfourmed openly by the Pope, but alſo it hath fallen out, that beſides him, no other did euer attempt it. <hi>3.</hi> And doth not the Biſhop openly boaſt him-ſelf to be God? reade <hi>Gratian diſtinct. 21.</hi> He acknowledgeth the name, he taketh it vpon him, he coumpteth it properly to belong vnto him, and repoſeth him-ſelfe in it. His clients clawe and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him as a God, they ſalute him by the name, and make more accoumpt of his authoritie and precepts, then thoſe of God. Heerein I faigne nothing, I ſpeake that that is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and well knowne vnto all. The Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> giueth it out that he is an earthly God, and vaunteth that he can do what-ſo-euer God can; <hi>Sinne only except:</hi> an impudent and blaſphemous mouth, hitherto all points do iompe and agree. But we haue not yet runne ouer the deſcription ſet downe by the Apoſtle, if theſe things be not ſufficient, marke what followes: <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paule) ye know what with-holdeth,</hi> namely, <hi>that he might be reueiled in his time.</hi> Heerein he ſheweth what it is that did ſtay or keepe backe the comming of Antichriſt. This ſame (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>which with-holdeth, Tertullian, Hierome,</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> do vnderſtand of the Romane Empire, the which ſo long as it ſtoode in flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing eſtate, Antichriſt could not riſe to that power and prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence; and therefore that roome might be made for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, it was requiſite that the Emperour of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould giue place. What this meaneth we ſhall eaſily vnderſtand, if we ſhall beare in mind that which <hi>Iohn</hi> fore-warneth in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation,</hi> as we ſhall ſee anone; namely, that <hi>Rome</hi> was to become the head and Metropolitane Citie for the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian kingdome. Seeing therefore that Antichriſt was to rule in <hi>Rome,</hi> neceſſarie it was that the Emperour ſhould leaue <hi>Rome</hi> emptie for him, for it could not be poſſeſt by both of them together. Now the iſſue &amp; euent of things hath ſhewed
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:11444:92"/> it ſelfe, to be a moſt plaine and plentifull interpretour of this prophecie. Firſt, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> tranſlated the Empire from <hi>Italie,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> into <hi>Greece</hi> vnto<note n="*" place="margin">Which is Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</note> 
               <hi>Bizantium:</hi> then the Greeke Emperours began by little and little, to loſe all their intereſt in <hi>Italie,</hi> ſo that at laſt <hi>Rome,</hi> the auncient ſeate of the Empire, together with a great part of <hi>Italie,</hi> began to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Biſhops hands. But where-as ſome vnderſtand this matter of the Preaching of the Goſpell, which the Apoſtle ſhould ſignifie, was firſt to be ſpread ouer the face of the whole earth: I will not gaine-ſay, but that both may be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Empire was to be moued out of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Goſpell to be preached ouer all the world. And touching the time where-in both theſe were perfourmed, it agreeth fitte. And where-as the Apoſtle writeth, that <hi>the miſterie of Iniquitie doth alreadie worke:</hi> he giueth vs to vnderſtand, that euen in his time the foundations were layde of that pontificall defection. And further he plainely teſtifieth, that this Antichriſt ſhould continue euen to the comming of Chriſt, when he ſaith, that <hi>the Lorde ſhall conſume him with the ſpirit of his mouth, and ſhall aboliſh him with the brightnes of his comming.</hi> Antichriſt may be appaired ſome-what, and diminiſhed by the preaching of the Goſpell, but he cannot be wholie diſpatcht before the comming of Chriſt. Now how Antichriſt was to get a kingdome, and obtaine a tyrannie, <hi>Paule</hi> doth herein declare, when he ſaith, <hi>His comming ſhall be by the working of Satan, with all power and ſignes, and lying wonders, and with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueablenes of vnrighteouſnes among them that periſh.</hi> It were impoſſible to vtter any thing more fitly agreeing with the kingdome of Poperie: for, except the Biſhop had a mightie, power-full, and diueliſh force in working, he could neuer haue ſo preuailed by his couzonages, deceipts, tricks of legierdimaine, and falſe miracles.</p>
            <p>Hitherto we haue heard <hi>Paule</hi> preaching of Antichriſt, and if <hi>Paule</hi> were a true Prophet, as we doubt not but he was a moſt true one, it is neceſſarie that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:11444:93"/> be Antichriſt: I do but point at the heads of verie weightie matters, for I may not now make long diſcourſes. Let vs come to the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> where-in, are moſt certaine euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and plaine teſtimonies of this our Antichriſt: theſe, what they are, let vs conſider. In the <hi>13.</hi> Chapter, after that <hi>Iohn</hi> had made mention of a Beaſt which had ſeauen heads, one head where-of being grieuouſlie wounded, was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward made whole againe, (which Beaſt, can not but be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode of the Romane Empire:) then it followeth in the <hi>11.</hi> verſe. <hi>And I ſawe an other Beaſt, comming vp out of the earth, and it had two hornes like vnto the hornes of the Lambe, but it ſpake like vnto the Dragon.</hi> The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts them-ſelues make no doubt, but that this Beaſt is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt: and I will prooue that it is the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who profeſſeth him-ſelfe to be the Lambs Vicar, and to be like vnto the Lambe: but yet if we marke well his ſpeach, we ſhall acknowledge him for a Dragon, and the verie De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. For who euer did vomit out more horrible blaſphemies againſt God, then this Beaſt hath done? goe ouer the reſt that followeth vnto the ende of the Chapter, ye ſhall ſée all thinges fall out iuſt by the prouidence of God. Who is it that put life into the dead image of the Beaſt, but only the Biſhop, who in his newe erected kingdome, hath liuely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and repreſented the ould Romane and Idolatrous Empire. For, looke what crueltie, couetouſnes, luſt, riot, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie, was long agoe found rife among the auncient Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, the Biſhops haue reſtored all that vnto the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. And it is moſt certaine and apparant, that he compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all men that will liue at all, and deale in his buſines and affaires, to beare his marke in their fore-heads, &amp; right hands. For except they giue vp their names vnto him, and eſteeme him to be reuerenced both in word and deede, they can not liue in ſafetie: Kings, Emperours, Biſhops, ritch, poore, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, learned, vnlearned and all, muſt ſerue him, kiſſe his feete, and worſhip this Beaſt. And as touching the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>666 <hi>Irenaeus,</hi>
               </hi> a verie auncient Father, and one that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:11444:93"/> liued neere vnto the time of the Apoſtles, hath opened the ſame. If we muſt needes make accoumpt of Apoſtolike tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, why may we not thinke that this was a tradition of the Apoſtle? Truly the Pope is a <hi>Latine</hi> by nation, faith, publike liturgie, yea and all his adherents he will needs haue to be Latines: he that is not a Latiniſt, they cry out that he is a Grecian, a Sciſmaticke, and Heretike. If it ſeemed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable vnto <hi>Irenaeus</hi> that this ſhould be the name of Antichriſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Latinus,</hi> it ought to ſeeme much more probable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, who haue had perfect proofe and experience of this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian <hi>Latine.</hi> Notwithſtanding, if any had rather referre it vnto the time of his reueiling, I will not greatly diſagree. For if vnto the yeare <hi>79</hi> where-in <hi>Iohn</hi> liued, and wrote his <hi>Reuelation,</hi> we adde the number <hi>666.</hi> and conſider the eſtate of the Church what it was in the yeare <hi>763.</hi> we ſhall ſee that Antichriſt was then growne to yeares, ruling in <hi>Rome,</hi> terrible with two ſwords, and worſhipped by Chriſtian men as a God. What neede we ſeeke more? or what could be more plainely fore-tolde? haue we need alſo of a toarch-light? And yet there are more euident proofes then theſe, which are mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> forceible to perſwade, although we were diſpoſed to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our ſelues againſt them. The Spirit of God did fore-ſee that queſtion and doubt might ariſe, touching the place where this Antichriſt ſhould raigne, and therefore he would alſo fore-warne all Chriſtians of the place, and ſo pointed out the Citie wherein Antichriſt ſhould ſit. And that is <hi>Rome,</hi> which <hi>Iohn</hi> both calleth <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the woman that ſitteth vpon ſeauen hilles, and the Citie that beareth rule ouer the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the world. He that doubteth that <hi>Rome</hi> is this ſame, I can not tell whether he haue any wit at all: the auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vnderſtood the miſterie. <hi>Tertullian contra Iudaeos,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Babylon</hi> repreſenteth in <hi>Iohn</hi> our Prophet, the figure of the Citie of <hi>Rome. <hi>Ierome</hi>
               </hi> vpon the <hi>47.</hi> Chap. of <hi>Eſay,</hi> in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. vnto <hi>Aſella,</hi> in the ende of his ſecond booke againſt <hi>Iovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> and in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prologue of his booke <hi>de ſpiritu ſancto,</hi> teſtifieth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:11444:94"/> 
               <hi>Auſtine</hi> in his <hi>18.</hi> Booke, <hi>De Ciuitate Dei, Cap. 22.</hi> affirmeth that <hi>Rome</hi> is an other <hi>Babylon,</hi> and a daughter of the firſt <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon. Oroſius. lib. 2. cap. 3.</hi> ſheweth by many reaſons, that <hi>Rome</hi> is in all points correſpondent vnto <hi>Babylon.</hi> But why do we ſeeke after the teſtimonies of men, and why do we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire further proofes, ſeeing <hi>Iohn</hi> him-ſelfe declareth, that this Citie, is that which is founded vpon ſeauen hilles. Let them name me if they can, any one Citie in the whole world, in <hi>Europa,</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> or <hi>Affricke,</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> or new-found <hi>America,</hi> where-in are to be found ſeauen hilles, beſides this our Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> the which all men knowe to be built vpon ſeauen hilles: the braueſt towne of all, that doth incloſe ſeauen ſeuerall hilles in compaſſe of a wall. The names of which hilles are as yet well knowne, <hi>Capitolinus, Palatinus, Aventinus, Caelius, Exquilinus, Viminalis, Quirinalis.</hi> And although it were ſo, that there could be found ſuch an other, yet this Citie only was ruler ouer all Kings and Nations. Therefore it is out of all controuerſie, that it is <hi>Rome</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh: yea and <hi>Rome</hi> not only as it was in times paſt, while her Emperours were Tyrants, (which the verie Papiſts acknowledge, becauſe they can by no meanes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide it, but that needes they muſt graunt that <hi>Rome</hi> is there meant) but as it was afterwards, when the Pope bare rule, which I will enforce out of the words them-ſelues: for <hi>Iohn</hi> deſcribeth <hi>Rome</hi> both touching the ould ſtate of the Empire, and alſo touching the ſtate there-of, being after renewed and reſtored, as it is euident in the <hi>13.</hi> Chapter. And as for the ruinous and decaied eſtate thereof, it was the Pope only that reſtored it, and which gaue life vnto that Image, which was as it were ſtarke dead: therefore he mentioneth and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth both the ſtates thereof. Afterwards, he in the <hi>17.</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, verſ. <hi>8.</hi> ſpeaketh plainely of the Beaſt which <hi>ſhould ariſe out of the bottomleſſe pit.</hi> Now as for the ould Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire, it was in force while <hi>Iohn</hi> was yet aliue: wherefore it is moſt certayne that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpake of the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops kingdome that ſhould after enſue. And this is that
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:11444:94"/> ſeauen-headed Beaſt where-of he ſpeaketh. Thus there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is euident, that thoſe things whiche <hi>Iohn</hi> heere wrote, are to be vnderſtoode of the kingdome and monarch of the Biſhop: other-wiſe, all thinges will be out of frame, and diſagree. To what ende ſhould I heape vp many things? what neede I adioyne vnto theſe heauenly oracles, being ſo manifeſt, ſo certaine, and ſo many in number, the teſtimonies of men, which are vncertaine and doubtfull, therefore I heere ende, gathering out of all that hath bin ſpoken, this moſt manifeſt and ſtrong concluſion:<note place="margin">The Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition.</note> If he be Antichriſt which oppoſeth him-ſelfe vnto Chriſt, which lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vp him-ſelfe againſt all that is called God, or is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, which hath brought an Apoſtacie or backſliding into the Church, which ſitteth in the Temple of God, which boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth him-ſelfe that he is God, which when the <hi>Italian</hi> and Romane Empire was ouerthrowne, vſurped vnto him-ſelfe a kingdome and tirannie, which immediatly after the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt, began in his fore-runners, which ſhall laſt to the end of the world, which hath Sathan for his fellow-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, which braggeth of his ſignes and wonders, counterfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelfe like vnto the Lambe, and yet ſpeaketh like vnto the Dragon, which reſtoreth the Image of the firſt Beaſt, which in euery reſpect is a right <hi>Latine,</hi> which poſſeſſeth <hi>Rome,</hi> the myſticall <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Citie with ſeauen hilles, which is clad in Purple, which is an Harlot, and which hath all the markes of Antichriſt, that are diligently and plainlie ſet downe in the Scriptures by the Spirit of God, (which of neceſſitie muſt needes be ſo, except we thinke that Antichriſt is ill ſet out by the holy Spirit:) then is the Romane Biſhop and no other, Antichriſt. But the antecedent (or firſt) is true, therefore the conſequent (or that that followeth) is alſo true. Thus haue I hitherto handled my matter in way of propug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or defence: now will I alſo, by the grace of Chriſt, maintaine the ſame agaynſt the oppugnation or battrie, that the graue Doctors ſhall bring agaynſt it.</p>
